If you're used to straight-up sugar, maybe these would taste off, like people think diet soda tastes bad if they're used to regular.<br /><br />As a diet soda drinker, these taste awesome to me!  I seriously want to drink one or two of them every day when I get home...and by the way, it's June now, so I imagine in the winter they'd be even better.  :-)  I think these also taste good cold.  I make them on the 10-ounce Keurig setting -- 8 ounces and they're too sweet...which is great, since I get 2 more ounces of cider.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd say give them a try...they're cheap, and I think they're awesome.

Thankfully they don't taste as retched as they smell, but they're still not good. I made two k-cups on two different days thinking maybe the first was just a bum cup...nope.<br /><br />My husband went to make a cup and he remarked right before putting the cup in the machine that it felt and sounded empty. Well, all he got was water with the slightest tint of brown to it. He tried a second cup...same thing happened. He finally said screw it and put in a k-cup of decaf coffee...came out perfect, so it was the cups that had the issue, not the machine.<br /><br />I absolutely do NOT recommend these. I can't compare the smell to anything, but it's truly disgusting. There has got to be a better cider k-cup out there somewhere.

The worst k-cup I've had by far.,"I've probably tried 40+ (maybe more than that) k-cup varieties thus far and this is the only one that is just plain horrible.  The powder rarely comes out correctly (and the fact that you are talking about a powered cider should stop you right there), it has a far too-sweet taste, and well, frankly, it just tastes bad.  My wife and I found the Green Mountain naturals Cider cups on clearance locally (we liked them so much we went back and bought like 16-18 boxes), but I have problems with sugar so I thought I would try this.  Bad idea.  It is borderline undrinkable.  It is, however, better cold than hot, but that's not saying much.  Low price, low quality.  Even the physically cup itself isn't made as well as the ""real"" k-cups.  It is made to fit in a Keurig brewer.  It is not a true k-cup.  Note that the title says ""for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"".  It is worded that way for a reason.  Avoid like the plague.  If you can handle sugar, check out the Green Mountain version.  If you can't, well, I've not found a better choice either.  In fairness, apparently everything this company makes isn't horrible.  My wife loves their Peppermint Hot chocolate.  Neither one of us can stand this crap however."

I liked it so much that I wanted to order for my sister in law. Placed the order and selected next day delivery to surprise her.  Well, that did not happen.  I would have at least expected a heads up from the supplier that next day delivery was not going to happen.  I am very disappointed!!"

I think it tasts pretty good....even my husband thought it was good; better than the spiced cider and he is pretty picky. a good drink for a cool, fall evening or winter day. We have our own well and only use well water or botten water which has no chlorine in it....I think if you are on city water and using city water it would definitely alter the taste. My daughter and son-in-law, and my colleague also enjoy it. I tried my colleagues and am ordering my own."

It is VERY sweet - - tastes pretty much like most instant cider mixes. For me, making it weaker improves the taste.  Again, the product works fine; my 2-star rating is based mostly on my personal dislike of the flavor."
418016,B009RB4GO4,A2ZXKFB2Q9OQO1,apasc,0,0,1,1348876800,Take the bad reviews seriously....,"I am addicted to caramel apple cider - and being only 10 calories and fairly inexpensive, I wanted so much to like this product. I thought even if it wasn't the best cider I'd ever had, it would at least be a good enough substitute for when I was watching my weight and couldn't afford to go to Starbucks. I was so wrong - what a waste of money! First off, it smelled so bad that it made me nauseous. I brought it to class with me, and was worried the whole time that everyone around me could smell it. Then, the taste was unbearable. I took a sip, gagged, tried adding some fat-free whipped cream, sugar-free caramel syrup, and cinnamon - still disgusting, the awful cider taste overpowered anything I put in. Needless to say, I wasted $10, will be throwing out all the k-cups, and will have to look for my cider fix elsewhere. Take the bad reviews seriously - I wish I had!"
418017,B009RB4GO4,A21JWIDR3CWA5Y,Carolyn Nelson,0,0,5,1348704000,Delicious,This cider smells and tastes wonderful.  Only 10 calories if you are counting.  Perfect on a chilly evening or if you are feeling a little under the weather.  It's a treat!
418018,B009RB4GO4,A2RZXV7LHGFQGX,"RhondaBear47 ""irhonda""",0,0,5,1348358400,Best SF hot drink EVER!,"I was a bit leery when I ordered this product but it is fabulous!  No aftertaste at all and if you set it on a smaller cup, it is just the right strength--not too weak at all.  I do doctor it a bit though.  Before I brew, I put about 6 cinnamon red hots in the cup, along with a cinnamon stick.  Then when done, I add a light sprinkle of my own mix of cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Almost as wonderful as my freshly simmered REAL apple cider!  The ""caramel"" part of this drink is what really makes it yummy!  Perfect for that cool autumn night, or anytime.  Highly recommend this drink!  And the price is wonderful too."
418019,B009RB4GO4,A1US0ADAQKIQSZ,Roslynd Lunaire,0,0,2,1347926400,Very Bad Taste,"This product is made with aspartamane, but that doesn't bother me. I only drink diet sodas instead of regular ones whenever I have the occassional soda (try to limit it to 1-2 a week) so the taste doesn't bother me, I also use Stevia and Spenda at home so I'm accustomed the the different sugar-free flavors.<br />I had such high hopes for this drink. I was looking forward to having a cup of hot cider at work. Granted I didn't think it would taste like real cider but I'd been looking forward to a hot apple-y drink.<br />When my shipment came in I brought it to work and had my first cup. Immediately I could smell it. It smelled really good at first. If you put your nose too close you can smell kinda a sickly-sweet scent. I tried it and nearly spat. It tasted extremely chemically and entirely overwhelming. The ""caramel"" was caramel only insofar as what a machine can reproduce. It was not caramel as I was expecting, not even slightly.<br />I tried letting it cool and drinking it cold. It was perhaps a teensy bit more palatable.<br />I tried watering it down. That helped. The Keurig at work only goes to 12 ounces. So perhaps ones that go to 16 ounces might diffuse the flavor a little more. This is why I gave it a 2 star instead of just 1.<br /><br />Now these things just sit forgotten in a drawer. Maybe I can figure out something to do with them..."

OFfers a variety to the keurig k cup line up besides the usual teas, coffee cocoa etc Hot cider is a fave  of mine so I decided to try the carmael apple first I do plan on coming back to buy more of these and to try the spiced cider variety of these too. Excellent product will recommend to family members and friends."
