"Not worth the money sound is terrible.",
"Easy set up",
"Poor audio and visual. After six months a black patch appeared on the TV.",
"DO NOT BUY!!!!!! bought this thinking aw surely it shouldnt not work the other people who reviewed must just be unlucky WRONG came and whole screen was messed up half black and buttons weren't working AVOID",
"Really good quality TV only problem is the remote has a mouse control like a Wii which is useless",
"Don't bother, tv came today and none of the apps would install, they all said MD5 verification fails. I assume it's a software issue. Won't be buying again, definitely returning it",
"Average picture quality. Remote control is so slow it is almost unusable. Have added Fire stick to get a useable interface.",

"only had the tv for a month or 2 and the smart channels don't work",
"Not working from new. Once connected to the mains, power led blinking red and green for 30 seconds then led remains green but the tv doesn't responds to the remote control. Couldn't go smart or choose a different source. The screen remains black all the time. Now I need to drive approx 20 miles to the parcel shop to return it . Not happy at all",
"Had to return remote was broke, but remote terrible looking quality also, tv looked fine good picture",
"Without doubt the worst piece of electrical equipment i have ever bought.
"Arrived in a box that was battered and looked to have been opened and resealed. The tv did not respond to the remote so was unusable. repackaged and returned. Avoid at all costs",
"My TV arrived, set up in minutes and works perfectly I would highly recommend considering this TV before looking at more expensive options",
"Add a soundbar to make viewing vunderbar its even clearer on standard definition, cannot download apps need a firestick problem solved",
"NOT a very smart, Smart TV .unable download apps that are not allready installed.an the remote is so slow to react it annoying.why a wi type remote ??? confussion with normal arrow keys! Buy British get Garbage.What a let down, no wonder it so cheap. Have to add price of a firestick or other device to make it smarter. Will avoid in future an not recomend any of there products.",
"Saw energy efficiency as A but when it was delivered, it is actually G.",
"Brilliant value for money, sharp picture, crisp sound and really easy to set up, only down side is that you can't add apps.",
"T.V fantastic the only downside the remote control not working with the TV i had to buy a new universal remote control. things are good now",
"Received TV on time , however the TV itself is a nightmare. HDMI connections leaving terribly poor visuals. Sound is hit and miss . Very upset as I wanted for Christmas now just have a gigantic TV boxed awaiting returns with date 1st FEB 2020 . !!!!!!!!!",
"Thw picture quality us quite bad in when the fiming is in a darkened part, ie when you are watching a show and it goes to night time shot or dark room it becomes obscure, the picture becomes unclear. Also it only has pre programmed apps which is something I didnt realise, I thought if it was a smart tv you would be able to add apps.",
"Not that bad but wasn't so convinced with the finishing housing all together. Few things seems to be loose!",
