"We cook a lot of Italian dishes in our house, some of which call for bread crumbs. We've tried a number of different brands and find that the Progresso bread crumbs are the best. They've got a great, spicy flavor, one that works particularly well in Italian meatballs. And our meatballs seem to hold together really nicely with them as well. Having settled on these, I don't think we'll be going back to any other brand of bread crumbs.",5.0,positive

"I started using the pod-style laundry detergent when I realized that others in my family couldn't manage to appropriately measure out either liquid or powder versions. I tried out these particular Gain pods when the Prime Pantry had a coupon available, making the 72-count a good value for me.

These pods do a great job cleaning a variety of loads, no issues at all with stains and dirt coming out (even with cold water, which I almost exclusively use). I usually remember to follow the instructions and put the pod in the empty drum before adding the dirty clothes, but I have also violated the rules by tossing it on top of the clothes or even after the washer started running. Regardless, the clothes got clean and the pod always dissolved completely.

My only issue is with the scent, which I find cloyingly sweet. I am not even sure how to describe it (""air from a moonlight stroll"" isn't exactly meaningful to me), except to say that it's strong and not ""clean."" I have used the green labeled Gain pods and really like that scent so I will go back to that version.  I usually go for scents that smell like soap---like fresh laundry!---and this one does not. Strictly a personal preference, others may really like the smell of this detergent.",4.0,positive

"I am not sure what to think here.  Many of the reviews are for the ""Chunk Light"" not the ""Solid White Albacore"" which is what I bought- and what I got.  That is the only option available, so I don't know why the verified purchases for light tuna are appearing here.  Additionally, some reviews are for the smaller pop top type cans that come in a multi-pack.  I quit buying chunk light tuna several years ago because of the decline to mushy texture and stronger fishy smell.  Full disclosure, I was buying Starkist, not Chicken of the Sea, but the Starkist chunk light tuna I grew up on had evolved into a product more like cat food than I cared to eat.  My only reason for trying this brand was BECAUSE it is labeled as Solid White Albacore, the price was better than my grocery store, and I had some room in my pantry box so this product popped up as a recommendation.  Had I come to the page and looked at the reviews or the photographs, I would absolutely positively passed on buying it.  The rusty cans shown at the top of the product page are disgusting.  It is not likely I will purchase this again even though the cans I received were fine and I couldn't really tell any difference from my usual brand.",5.0,positive

"First off, I have TWO of these units, the first I'd purchased from Amazon, the second was a replacement sent free by Amazon when I requested a return on the first due to accuracy issues. I also have several vintage weather stations, with USA-made, mechanical hygrometers which I trust to be fairly accurate. Those all read within a few % of each other. I have them in several locations around my house, but wanted a small, unobtrusive temp/humidity gauge for my daughter's room that wouldn't detract from her 'decor'.

To test the first unit I'd received I simply put it in my basement (where the humidity doesn't fluctuate widely unless it's raining) next to wall-mounted weather station for comparison. The 'Accurite' unit ALWAYS READS WAY UNDER the actual room humidity - sometimes as close as 8% under, but usually more, like 12% under.  The second unit I received as replacement acts much like the first, although their readings for humidity always differ from each other, usually they're as close as 2%, but sometimes as much as 6%, and it stays that way for hours (so it's not some sudden change like the furnace coming on that's the problem). I should note their temperature display is pretty close, within 1-2 degrees of actual - close enough to work with,  if only the hygrometer were as accurate.

The reviewer who claimed to have subjected theirs to a test chamber and praised it's resulting accuracy...maybe the hygrometers in these units only work well in a test chamber. I need something to work in my home, and a bogus reading of 39% when the actual humidity is 51% is pathetic.

FYI, while writing this review I found a website that shows up close to the top of googled results for 'hygrometer', 'nwclimate.org', that hosts an article titled '8 Best Digital Hygrometers Suitable for Your Home', with this 'AcuRite' model making the top of the list. Considering their numerous spelling and grammatical errors (even the article's title is awkward), and their (unintentionally lukewarm) recommendation of this unit, describing the hygrometer function as 'good accuracy if you are not interested in the exact percentage; for relative ranges it does a good job', I'd judge these devices to be the cheapest made and hardest-sold imported junk on the web.",1.0,negative

"I have been using HATCHBOX exclusively ever since I got a 3D printer but lately I have been encountering an issue on several of their filament spools. After about half of the spool has been used, there is sometimes a point where the leading filament is looped under the rest of the spool creating a tangle. This has caused failed prints because the filament is no longer feeding through the extruder. This is especially frustrating when I set up a print before I head into work and come home to find the print head moving around in the air because it stopped feeding quite some time ago. This has also created jams in the extruder and it wastes my time having to clear a jam.

However, when it doesn't have this problem, I am real happy with the results. I have given away prints as gifts and made things which I use day to day.

"The 3 packets with correct amounts of sugar/banana were quite tasty with a light banana flavor and enough nuts for most bites to have a bit of crunch (although the nut flavor didn't come through much).  The other 3 had little to no banana and no sugar at all.  The 3 packets which were not properly proportioned tasted like a cardboard box, even after adding sugar to make them somewhat edible.  50/50 is not good enough so I'll not try this one again.

It's a shame Quaker stopped selling individual boxes of their Bananas and Cream Oatmeal variety long ago.  It's a better tasting product with more banana flavor but having to purchase a variety box containing the Peach and Strawberry flavors to get the Banana and the Blueberry packets becomes tiresome.",2.0,negative

"What the heck do I know? Hailey Green, who submitted the idea for Lay's Southern Biscuits and Gravy, will take home a $1 million grand prize or one percent of her winning flavor's net sales through July 15, 2016 (whichever is higher). Although, I cannot imagine the net sales will be the higher figure.

The white gravy-flavored chip tastes first of black pepper and sour cream before the sausage and sage flavoring engages. Instead of a pleasant umami combination, the chip devolves into something akin to pasty, powdery salt. The texture doesnt help. I cant help but wonder if a ridged (ruffled) chip wouldve worked better with this flavor profile, which evokes thoughts of fluffy biscuits rather than greasy potato chips. The seasoning is caked on the flat chips so thick as to render them chewy instead of crisp.

"Not horrible, but not good either.
Iv clocked well over 4000 prints on my 5, 3d printers, and this Hatchbox filament is fairly consistent in diameter which is usually the big quality issue, so good there.. but after printing 1 spool of Hatchbox (black) filament i had to strip and clean my hot end to remove an odd buildup of burnt material adhering to the stainless steel filament path and making flow intermittent,.. ~4000 prints under my belt, and I have never seen build up like this before with any other PLA. Was it contaminated, does it have filler, are they blending,. I don't know, all i know is that I did not receive pure PLA.
The other big issue is color,. I ordered red, what i got was labeled red,.. but the color on the spool was most certainly orange. I am a photographer, I know color, so I am not just being picky, this is tangerine at best, and nowhere near as close to red as the re-colored photo shows.
Ultimately I returned the ""red"", and if i had any black on the spool to return I would have returned that also.
Oh, and i didn't even get a form response when i wrote to them asking nicely about the color issue. aka 0 customer service. For that i just knocked off one of the two stars I was going to give due to the diameter tolerances being fairly tight.",1.0,negative

"This is a legitimate, intelligible 1-Star review for this Toilet Paper. It's marketed as dual-textured, double rolls, but the only truth behind that is that, yes, they are double rolls. The issue is they're nowhere near dual-textured. When you rip it off the roll they tear easily in half. You have to focus when you tear a sheet off so that it doesn't rip off at a random location. When you're wiping, it's easy to push your finger through the paper, even when you double over the sheets.  Toilet paper from the dollar store is better than this brand. The only decent takeaway is buying these in bulk saves you some money, but once you realize you now have 12 of these terrible rolls for the next month or two, that instantly become a headache.

"First of all, know this; I always use new batteries when ordering anything that requires them, usually at the same time I place an order, but not necessarily from the same company;

This one failed miserably; I put this one in storage when I received them about 2-months ago but when it came time to put it to good use,the display died shortly after power-up. It did work for a few minutes, but quickly went blank.

Suspecting a display issue, I moved the connection from a known good set-up to the bad display to see if the problem would follow it, and as suspected, it did. Just to verify the connector and it's associated wiring, I moved the sensor cable to a known good display, the combination was successful.

The item I have is now known to be defective but since I already missed Amazon's 30-day return window, it is now hoped this one gets read by the seller for whatever resolutions they may have.

Would I buy another one?, maybe, maybe not; I bought two of them in the past and they still work OK; I suppose it would depend on what happens here; the working ones I have in service seem a bit sensitive to static, but they work none-the-less... so, here's hoping to hear from them.",2.0,negative

I rinsed as best as I could. Looking back I should have re-shampooed with my regular shampoo and used my conditioner but I didn't. I have NEVER had so much trouble combing out my wet hair. It was unbelievably tangled. After drying it, it was so full of electricity it was just standing up in the air and my hair is below shoulder length.

"This is a very good tasting soup. Unlike many canned soups it's not excessively salty. Granted, you won't feel the need to add salt, but it's reasonably well balanced with regard to salt.

It is a bit on the thin side. While the term ""hearty"" is in the title, I don't think it reaches that mark, with a lot of broth present. The meat, while tasty, is in very small pieces.  The veggies are sparse and somewhat mushy. On the plus side, the potatoes are cut large and are of good consistency -- soft, but not mushy.

I find it works best with the addition of some beans, more veggies and/or some wild rice. Additions dial up the ""hearty-ness"" while preserving the overall good taste.

I picked this up to round out a recent Amazon Pantry order, but I would certainly buy it again.",4.0,positive

Since it is made from rather thin pasta, but is then rolled, it is hard to get it cooked to exactly the right degree of doneness.

"I have the 100 calorie packs, 94% fat free.  I was looking to add a little bit of fiber to my diet without breaking the bank (in terms of calories, that is).  I wanted to feel like I was getting a lot to eat, which is something popcorn always does for me.

I find this basically pretty good.  It is not the most delicious microwave popcorn I've ever had, but it is certainly acceptable for a reduced fat product.  It's salty without being overly salty, though there is a fair amount of sodium if you look at the nutrition facts label -- about 10% of your daily recommended maximum.  (You can see the full nutrition facts panel if you zoom in on the product images.)

I did not have many unpopped kernels.  There were a few.  However, I did overcook this the first time...  I can't say how long you should let it pop because that will vary based on your microwave.  (For me, the ideal time was around two minutes.)  I would strongly recommend staying in the room so you can hear the rate of popping, though.  There was a fair amount that got stuck in my teeth, so if you have problems with that, you may want some floss or a toothpick or something similar handy.

A lot of the ""butter"" flavor stuck to the bottom of the package.  I suppose that cuts down on the number of calories and amount of salt that I consumed, though I *may* have run my finger over that part of the package a few times to get a taste of that stuff.  I would like it if more of that ended up on the popcorn, although the flavor was OK as is.

In the end, this provided a filling snack and was a reasonable compromise between flavor and calorie content, so I can't complain.  I would buy this again.",4.0,positive

"The description on the product page seems to indicate that this is a two in one or all in one style shampoo and conditioner combo type product, but the instructions on the actual bottle say otherwise. The bottle states clearly to use the Clear Shampoo Total Care Shampoo with their Total Care Conditioner.  That's important, because using this shampoo alone left my long, thick and healthy hair feeling dryer than usual, tangled and looking like a giant puffy mushroom when I dried it. I had to use a spray on, leave in conditioner and do the ""bad hair day pony tail"". Not amused.

Using this with a regular conditioner was better, but not much. The shampoo itself smells nice - a light and airy coconut scent that isn't overwhelming. It lathers well and my hair is clean, but twice I've been forced to resort to the pony tail look and adding the extra leave in conditioner after my shower. This shampoo is definitely stripping moisture or something from my normally soft hair. I'll be returning to my Suave Moroccan Infusion.

"I purchased this to seal a small hole in a rubber pig. The product description said it could be used on rubber so I decided to give it a try. My Dobie's favorite toy is a pink rubber pig that squeaks. One day I noticed that he was pulling out the pig's insides through a small tear in the side. Because it is such a tiny tear I did not think there woud be any harm in using an adhesive. When I received this Loctite I read all the information on the back of the package. There are a lot of directions and a good bit of technical data. There is a section labeled ""DANGER"" that warns of the various dangers of using this product.  One of the warnings is that inhaling the vapor may be harmful or fatal. There is a ""WARNING"" that states ""This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer, etc"". Obviously I can not use this on the pig that my Dobie carries in his mouth.

I give this one star based solely on my inability to use this item for the reason it was purchased. I have no other need for this item. One star is probably not fair but it is the only rating I can give based on my lack of usage due to the severe warnings.

"Sorry Charlie, but Homey don't play the rest of that song, cuz it ain't nuttin' honey.

Which brings us to Bumble Bee tuna, the brand that has always had to try harder, what with that mental picture of bees covering the fresh catch of the day.

In each can is about 75 grams of protein, and I can mix it with hard boiled eggs and wash it all down with a protein shake, making a protein sandwich and a shake muscle meal for about $5.

I'm here today to swear on my Mama's grave, well she's not quite dead yet, that this tuna is, I think I'll get up and walk around a bit, the absolute best that I've ever had from a can.

With the traditional canning technique used, you will need an opener, but you'll first notice it's odor, which is like fish, rather than tuna fish from a can. Then you'll remove some and realize that the flesh is firm and flaky, not soft and squishy.

You'll be wondering, if this really is tuna fish, then just what was I being fed all those years growing up?

So drain a can and into a bowl with it, and my latest recipe is salt, a couple tablespoons of Thousand Island and hot sauce, and then mix it, grab your crackers and dinner's served. But next week who knows?

Just remember that I mentioned that you'd first notice it's odor, and now everyone else will notice yours, so use a breath mint or two.",5.0,positive

"Had this about one year, and it worked fine. We have a long haired cat, and cleaning the brush was problematic and time consuming, but the vac did get the hairs up off the floor. Then, one day, I got it to use on the stairs, and it would not start. The battery showed full charge, but it was dead in the water. Nothing. Kaput. Way out of the warranty period, so being a skilled handy man, I began taking it apart and testing each component as I did. Battery was in excellent condition. Impressive. Front brush cleaner worked great. Main vacuum motor also was great - very powerful. I was  jumping the components to test them and using a VOM as well. So, bench testing was all OK. Hmmm.  However, after narrowing down the components, I discovered the switch was dysfunctional. I found a small component to the switch's circuit board that had fallen off. I first jumped it, no joy; then I re-soldered it, but still nothing. So, conclusion was that after a year of good use, the circuit board attached to the mechanical switch failed. No way I could replace or repair the circuit board. So, I had to deep six the whole thing. Sad. I won't buy another one.",2.0,negative

"First, I will say that this is the first and only PLA filament I have ever tried, so I do not know if it is specifically this PLA or just PLA in general that is horrible. I've printed hundreds of hours in ABS for almost a year now and not a single clog or jam. I've tried over a dozen prints with this PLA in the last couple of weeks, and all have failed because the nozzle would eventually jam. After each jam I would adjust the temperature and speed settings trying to find a combination that worked. Prints would usually start out looking great, but the nozzle would jam on every single one. Most jams would be easily dislodged, but currently I have one that I can not remove. I am to the point that I am most likely going to have to purchase a new $100 extruder for my printer. I will never use PLA in my printer again.

In all fairness, I will say that I have used this SainSmart brand in ABS and have never had a problem and will continue to use their brand of ABS if I ever get my printer working again. I will never use this or any brand of PLA again though. I wanted to try it because I've heard it doesn't warp/shrink as bad as ABS, but if all PLA is as prone to jamming as this spool was, it is not worth the hassle.",1.0,negative

"I purchased Kashi Cookies Oatmeal Raisin Flax at the natural foods store located less than one mile from my house.  Opening the package immediately upon arriving home, I found not eight cookies, but a container of small crumbled pieces.  The contents of the package could have been a granola-style cereal had they not been labeled cookies.

Although I expected the Kashi Cookies Oatmeal Raisin Flax to be individually wrapped, they were not.  Instead they were held in a two-space, divided plastic container that was enclosed in a wrapping similar to that used for candy bars.  Because Kashi products are low in fat and have few ingredients that bind the others together, they do not remain intact during shipping.

I ended up using the crumbled Kashi Cookies Oatmeal Raisin Flax as cereal.  The cookies were tasty, but very dry.  Due to their fragile nature, I will not be purchasing the product again.  I would not recommend purchasing this product for delivery.  These cookies are five-star tasty, but only if you like crumbs.",2.0,negative

"I purchased this Panasonic Microwave the end of MAY 2011 (this year) (It is now ONLY Aug Of 2011)  It Looked Great out of the box, as It should be when purchasing a microwave from a higher end Manufacturer or so I thought..... Let me just start by saying The issues I had was through NO fault of AMAZON, they delivered it just fine. The issue is with the PANASONIC CORPORATION AND THE LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDED.
The Microwave started to display an error code 2 days ago.  I called Panasonic Directly.  I was Told in no uncertain terms that Panasonic WILL NOT REPLACE the unit even though it is less than 90 days old, regardless of defect! I tried to explain to the ""Customer Service"" specialist that this unit has a 1 year warranty, to which I was Informed by said specialist: that, It is ""MY responsibility"" to pay to ship the unit to one of Panasonics ""Certified Panasonic service / Repair Companies"" (that is 2 hours away.)  And.... after the unit is received, The repair company will decide if it is infact ""in need of repair or  If it was damaged by me"" ?!@ Really??
Then she had the nerve to tell me that the error code displayed on My broken microwave is interpreted as an "" electrical current issue on my end"". And , that she Recommends that I Pay to have an electrician come to my home and instal a designated circut for just this microwave alone.  Excuse me???  I explained again, that this was not my FIRST Microwave, and that I have NEVER heard of a ""Non Specialty"" microwave needing to have its own circut breaker and that My home was built less than 5 years ago, and that it was Ludicris to insinuate the failure was on my end!!
I am more than upset, I did a lot of searching to find a worthy Microwave unit.  In today's economy, It is shameful for Big Business to take the money I paid for this Microwave unit, I expected more from a well known company but found out that both my MONEY and the ""Panasonic company name"" were both worthless!!!.  I will NEVER purchase another product from a company that puts out defective merchandise and in turn,  tries to blame the Customer for it!!  Terrible!!  Shame on you Panasonic!!",1.0,negative

"I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.

As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.

Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.

Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""",5.0,positive

It may be healthier but when i buy peanut butter cereal i expect it to taste like it... but their cereal tastes more like Kix.. just bland puffed corn balls.

I wish Panda Puffs tasted just like captain crunches peanut butter crunch but it doesn't even come close.",2.0,negative

Keeping them well fed is crucial since their working long hours. But keeping it simple is important to. Well that's where these stand up taco shells worked perfectly. I just used a large aluminum pan-lined up rows of taco shells-filled with meat,cheese and lettuce. Done. The only thing extra I was a container of Salsa. No paper plates needed. Just napkins.

"If you know what bucatini is, then this is good bucatini pasta.

If you are unfamiliar with bucatini, this is FAT spaghetti with a really thin needle sized hole through the strand of ""spaghetti"".  This isn't a good replacement for folks who just want to chow down on spaghetti. It can't be twirled with a fork.  It must be cut first -- you need some manners -- before it gets on the fork.  The pasta is just too sturdy and thick to ""swirl"".

However, your diners will like this BETTER than spaghetti if they have the patience to cut the past before putting it on the fork.  It holds sauce well, feels substantial, and is just plain more interesting than spaghetti.

I recommend for a change of pace from regular ol' spaghetti, but know your diners -- they might be confused that it can't be twirled(!",4.0,positive

"I have used a different but similar cart for years, and the bed finally split.  I don't like one wheeled wheelbarrows, because the load is high and they are easy to tip.  I see no reason to spend any more than the $50 this one costs.

1. The floor is not flat, as my old unit was, to make it easier to mix the load with a shovel.  However, it seems that the flat plastic floor style of my old unit is not as strong as this style of plastic, and this style also makes a narrower cart, which is easier to get through some spots. Unlike the old cart, I don't see any areas that are weak by design. I figured that I should be able to get at least as many years out of this cart (5 or more).  Unfortunately I got less than 1 year.
2.  These wheels are large enough to roll easily, although not as large as my old cart.  I did not want tires that pump up--my experience with those is that eventually they don't hold air anymore. That style is expensive to replace or repair.  The wheels on the old cart are still good, and I estimate that these will be good for some years to come.
3.  The cart dumps well, and the walls are higher than most.  It lists a 200 pound capacity.  Unless you are a 27 year old weight lifter or farmer, you probably won't want to carry more than 120 pounds in a cart anyway.  It does not bend when I dump 40 pound loads at a time into it.  If you need to move more than this, buy a $250 steel and wood wheelbarrow.",1.0,negative

It is every bit as gentle as they say it is--no burning sensation in my eyes when I use this to wash my hair.

"The picture is misleading. It shows a wheel that was machined. The actual wheel is made of sintered iron (looks like cast iron but it is easier to manufacture) and painted grey. It comes with all the pitfalls of chap casting, the major one being dimensional variability. There are more holes and smaller. The axle is bolt and nut - a plus because you can take it apart and add 10mm flat washers to stop the wheel moving from side to side. The bad part is that the wheel hole for the axle is not centered in the middle of the wheel and that the wheel hub side faces are not parallel to the wheel or to each other. So if you shim it with washers you will also have to clean the hub faces. Also the wheel hole for the axle is larger than the axle and even after shimming you will still get some side play. On the plus side is that the load is higher than the similar sized plastic wheels - the reason I bought them. You can also use more of them and mount them in a row to increase total load capacity while still maintaining maneuverability.
Unfortunately I could not find a better quality 2"" fixed wheel with same load capacity even if I wanted to pay more.",2.0,negative

"Updating review: No, it too is coming undone from the sun heat. We had a 97F degrees yesterday; and the transponder had fallen off the windshield. Also, I had used it to glue a magnet to the inside of a plastic lid of my tool box; the inside is very smooth and I cleaned it with Isopropyl alcohol; the magnet held a measuring square; But, after a while, the magnet too kept on falling from the tape. It's not very high bonding for these uses anyway.
Original review: It's working very good so far. I didn't like the fact that it was not very neatly and tightly coiled. The coiled tape looks as though it was hand coiled and done so rather poorly as there are a lot of places in the coils with air gaps between the layers. I'm sure these places will lose adhesion strength sooner than the air tight places. But, It's boarder line acceptable wrapping/coiling. The adhesion is excellent. I had a problem with the sticky hook and loop strips I was given with the express lane transponder. The heat from the sun on hot days, would cause the strips to separate from the plastic backing. I tried a few other product, but with the same results. These did the trick.",2.0,negative

"Doesn't appear to be accurate to me. It's hard to tell for sure because which one is authoritative. I have 4 thermometers including this one. My use case is an incubator and this isn't nearly accurate enough. When the incubator says 33% humidity this thing will read 60%. When the temp says 104F and my other two thermometers say 98F I'm gonna believe the other two. I decide to try a different use case and stuck it on top of my furnace thermostat that's digital and this one said 68 and the thermometer said 70. So I bought another thermometer with Hygrometer. I get a 3rd off the wall reading that doesn't match up with the incubator or this hygrometer. My best guess is this this is plus or minus about 2-3 degrees off. Hygrometer I have no idea I have 3 readings varying from 30 - 60% humidity and I don't trust any of them. The 3rd thermometer lined up with another thermometer, but this one was 4 degrees higher. When a few degrees matters don't get this one. I also notice it doesn't update regularly it seems to update every couple minutes because it makes several degree jumps at regular intervals, instead of a steady transition. I wouldn't recommend it.

"I just recently discovered that my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has a variety of green teas. Wonderful! I was introduced to cold green tea about a year ago and I loved it. Now I can buy Teas' Tea Jasmine Green Tea quickly and easily. It's rather expensive, but soooo good! It's only ingredients are purified water, jasmine green tea and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The taste is light and utterly refreshing. I'd take this unsweetened tea over any kind of sweetened tea any time. After you get used to it, regular iced tea just will never suffice. I wonder how long it will be before this stuff starts appearing in restaurants. I haven't noticed any as yet. Believe me, it's only a matter of time.

"This product is a shipping and handling ripoff.
The seller claims ""This item is 1.98 pounds or 4.4% of a Pantry box. ""
One 12.5 oz net weight  can does NOT weigh TWO POUNDS and it does NOT fill  4.4%  of a a FOUR CUBIC FOOT box.

It is the same can as the 9.75oz but it is, maybe, 1/2""  taller to hold the additional 2.75 oz.
...even if it weighed one pound(16 oz) gross, it would still only be 2.1 or 2.2% of the box(like almost every other 16oz food product).

Other than that, Swanson chicken breast in a can is as probably as good as it gets for chicken _in a can_.  BTHOO the stuff they(Campbells, Progresso, ...etc.) use in soups.

Its really like this just a standard pinhole spy cam with a really long USB cord attached to it.  Adjustable LEDs work fine except you can't completely turn them off.  Even at their minimal setting they are extremely bright which just means harsh reflections inside anything metallic like a duct.  I assume they did this to prevent these things from being abused as spy cams so some would see it and know they are being recorded.  But that totally negates its use as a scope in a reflective environment.

Maybe I just got one that didn't have its focal point adjusted correctly or something, but as it is it won't work as advertised.

"Absolute junk, I have no idea why this product is so highly reviewed. I'd suggest these might be only good for plastic or extremely thin wall tubing.

When they arrived, I immediately noticed they didn't appear very sharp.

One of the bits worked for enlarging 2 or 3 holes in low-grade, rusty, mild steel tubing (a boat trailer.) The rest of the bits wouldn't even make a dent: Even going slow with lots of oil and a large starting size, most of the bits wouldn't even start cutting! I also tried going fast, and tried different sizes. All but one bit was entirely worthless. The one bit that did work, only enlarged 3 holes before it stopped working.

For comparison, I have a single step drill bit from the big-red-brand sold at the big-orange-store that I have used for years drilling exactly this same kind of material. I felt it was getting a little slow, so I decided to try these. In the end, I wound up going back to my old, heavily used step bit that was not really that much more expensive, and it worked far better than any of these bits.

"Purchased this device to use alongside a Caliber III digital hygrometer for the purpose of dialing in the humidity setting on our Frigidaire FAD704DWD dehumidifier.  The humidistats on the Frigidaire and many other dehumidifiers are notoriously inconsistent and by having a couple of independent sources of info as to the RH in the room, I am able to more accurately establish an appropriate setting (regardless of the skewed number that may be displayed on the dehumidifier).

Unfortunately, after close monitoring over a period of several days, it appears that the AcuRite consistently reads 5% or so below the actual room RH based upon readings from other devices.  The temperature reading was (usually) within a degree (Farenheit) of the other devices but it was the RH that I was after.

"Grabs onto dust and holds it!  I like these because they're disposable, hold the dust that they pick up, fit into tighter places, and they are so much more convenient than a rag!

They get a little bunchy and snag on some surfaces, and they're a bit expensive...  But if you hate dusting like I do these make it much more pleasant!",4.0,positive

"I picked this up on a deal and didn't think much about it at first, but I started noticing that I was putting in a lot more elbow grease than normal. I kept resorting to warm water. ""Wow, this stuff really works great when you just add warm water,"" I thought. The next go-round I skipped out on the cleaner and went straight to the water. I knew that there was still bacteria everywhere, but my elbow leaked not a drop of grease. I've switched back to good ol' Johnson & Johnson. While I have issues with chemicals, I'd rather just use conventional products in moderation and have a clean house. I'm willing to bet a bottle of lemon juice concentrate would do just as good a job.",1.0,negative

"I do read reviews. Usually, if a product has a positive rating with a great amount of persons, I feel safe in trying it. I know, my opinion might be different, but I feel that I can't be THAT disappointed. I usually do not use negative reviews for fear of sounding like some that do so, but it is cleatr that they are condeming a product for something that it did not claim or was supposed to DO! If I see an abundance of negative feedback, I will mostly always pay heed, and DON'T even GO there. I know this scored high, but off all of the cheap 2.00 detergents I have ever used.....this is HORRIBLE and it WASN'T inexpensive. I tried it because of the name, and I am trying to be more Earth conserving recycling conscious in EVERY product that I use. I was surprised at how much is ""lathered/soaped"" when using a little to wash in sink...and it LASTED. However, after letting something soak, that was not really visably too dirty, it looked a bit WORSE. I thought, ok maybe it is my imagination so I repeated the same thing 3 more times....now seemed to show soiled areas MORE! After I hung to dry....it did not smell ""fresh"" even though it did when I hung to dry! This has NEVER happened before. I will admit  I DO like things to at LEAST SMELL clean, even though I am sure some detergents are misleading in this way. Well, this one was....after drying NO SMELL and item appeared to maybe be more soiled after soaking in sink for HOURS.",2.0,negative

"I've ordered the natural applesauce from Amazon before--as my husband likes these no-sugar ones best. Usually, they come in the stacked packs. These were loose and just thrown in a box. THREE had to be thrown away due to being damaged and spilled out. One was dark and spoiled (really gross). I had to wash several of the containers that got spillover.

Be careful of ordering if you don't like them tossed willy nilly. I don't know why before I got them in the usual packs like in the store and this time just a jumble of loose containers. But I don't like that packing method (hence 1 star off).",4.0,positive
"I bought these thinking they would be tortilla chips with a hint of lime and chili flavor. These chips are very heavily seasoned (more of a Dorito style chip than a tortilla chip). The flavor is good but overpowering if you intend to use these chips with any type of dip.

Unfortunately most of the chips that I buy through amazon arrive broken or smashed.

PROS:
Organic chips
Reputable brand
Nice crunch

CONS:
Too much seasoning
Chips through Amazon often arrive broken",2.0,negative

"I have a half-finished counter-height wall that is the perfect ""test wall"" for this device.  It is finished on one side, and the beams are exposed on the other side (no drywall yet on one side).  Each time I ran the scanner across the wall, it would show phantom wood beams or conduits between the studs where none exist.  Often, it would show really fat wood beams which are actually thin 2x4s.

The instruction manual says to scan really slow to improve the accuracy, but if you scan slow then the device will complain and tell you to scan above the minimum speed.

I wonder if this really uses a RADAR sensor, or whether the ""RADAR"" terminology is only for marketing and it just contains a mix of conventional sensors.  Whatever the case, DeWalt must have released this product on the market by accident because it doesn't work.  The other reviews appear to be right on.",1.0,negative

trouble keeping a 25 ft. extension cord straight, and these are 100 ft. long. Also, the roll was ordered for easy storage and to keep the product

from tangling. So much for planning. I think Amazon needs to modify this vendors ad so others will know what they're getting. And just so you

know, this vendor's only warning of this material being loose is on your invoice, of course at that point, you've already placed your order. Now,

when do I check my invoice? When there's a problem, like now.",1.0,negative

"These are not a favorite.  They barely tasted like cheesecake and were missing the creaminess I associate with cheesecake and the richness I look for in chocolate.  Plus, it's just odd to eat anything pretending to be cheesecake at room temperature.  Definitely not buying again.

Pros: good source of fiber

Cons: 50%-60% more calories than most fiber one individual snacks I've seen, not creamy, not rich chocolate

If I could change anything about this product: nothing

Packaging type: as pictured - I received a regular retail box like you'd see in a grocery store.

I've always counted on Tom's of Maine products to be natural, so I was very surprised when I got home and realized that this does contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which can be very irritating on the skin.

Natural products also don't usually provide much foam or lathering, but they are still effective.  This product still doesn't lather, but the SLS is reason enough for me to toss it out.

It's very disappointing to see that Tom's has changed their formulation after being bought by Colgate!",2.0,negative

"Given the price of these I expected great things from them. They are short thin rods and small enough to get inside even a 9mm case. But, they are so heavy compared to the brass case that they go to the bottom in my tumbler and the brass ""floats"" on top. Nothing go cleaned very well at all. The more stainless material I added, the quicker I realized the process was going nowhere. Not wanting to waste a bunch on money I took a few handfuls and added it to the walnut shell media. There it made a difference. Brass came out shinier and showed no signs of damage. They will be a bit difficult to separate from the walnut media once it needs replacing but be a major project. A vacuum held far enough away to not suck up the stainless rods will still grab the small walnut shell pieces. Running the tumbler to get all the rods to the bottom will make things even easier.",2.0,negative

Panasonic has always been the best. Going to another brand. And yes-they have bad ones also. This  wouldn`t cook more than 3 minutes when it was working. It smelled like burning electricity.

the taste is one note, with way too much heat.......

"Solutech comes in middle to upper range in print quality but is last and unusable due to the way the filament and the narrow spools like to fight each other, the narrow spool kicks loops off to the side before the extruder needs them due to the brittle stiff filament.  Just had to disassemble entire hotend and bowden setup from this clear yet again screwing up a simple print.  kicked loops out to side onto spool holder, cinched up and stopped spool feeding, ground filament in extruder, stopped extruding and air printed, hotend clogged from this brittle clear filament seizing above the melt zone.  For like the 10th time, having used less than 5% of the spool.  Most filament is a little 'lively' and wants to uncoil, but this stuff is like satans filament, jumps off the spool while printing and then stops everything working correctly.

Probably going to try and transfer the nearly full spool of filament to a better wider spool so it might get a print off but never buying Solutech again.  Sort of angry at fighting this stuff for several days of failed prints when other filaments work so much better for me.  The brittleness and stiffness and coil tightness, combined with narrow spools, make this stuff a nightmare for me.  Surfaces look great but can't get the darn stuff to feed well and when it seizes up it clogs the hotend sooooo bad.",1.0,negative

"What can I say about Catalina dressing? It's just about my favorite French style dressing. I especially enjoy it on a raw spinach and other ingredients salad, and I love mixing it in with cole slaw to make a very flavorful cole slaw, which reminds me of the cole slaw they sold at a Fried Chicken place in Chicago back when my parents lived there (1969-1973). I don't remember the name.

I give the regular Catalina dressing FIVE stars, but only FOUR stars for the Fat Free variety. Why is this? Because a scientific study showed that the body gets MORE nutrition out of a salad when you use a ""regular fat"" salad dressing than when you use a ""fat free"" variety. (I am a verified purchaser of this Fat Free dressing only because I didn't notice it was Fat Free when I ordered it. That was my mistake, but I'll still use it with the cole slaw I buy at WalMart deli, because it will already have a fatty dressing on it.

I highly recommend the regular variety of Catalina dressing to you, but if you must, the fat-free variety is still good.

"It is a decent printer, not the best resolution, but for the money, it's a functional 3d printer.  It get's errors from time to time, but CS has been 'helpful' in fixing them.  I have found that 3rd party forums are a better source of info though.  The CS from XYZ is quite demanding in their info requests, ie 4-5 emails a day demanding serial numbers from various locations on the printer.

The filament cartridges are a joke though.  They are proprietary and of poor quality.  There was a common practice of resetting the cartridges using a resetter, but now the latest firmware update prevents this.  It remotely reports back to XYZ what you have been printing and if they detect you are using a reset cartridge, they remotely disable your printer.  That's right, they intentionally brick your printer.

I stuck wires in many of the holes and measured the resistance, I found it would change drastically from an ohm to completely open just by slightly moving the wires. Completely useless.

The power connections at the top are horrible. They are those spring connectors you find on the back of cheap speakers. Not reliable with 22 gauge wire.

"The actual silicone delivered from this canister is excellent quality and performs well for preventing vibration induced loss of mechanical items.

I bought a box of these and although the dispensed product works well I would not recommend this and I will not be purchasing further items with this type of dispensing mechanism.

"First, I should say that my house is far from ideal for the upcoming robot vacuum invasion. There's a ton of stuff on the ground - rugs, cords, dog beds, furniture, ...dogs.  I have an older generation Roomba for pets and it's really a 50/50 chance on whether or not the unit will be stuck somewhere or parked properly on its charging station when I wake up in the morning.

Much like the Roomba, this Moneual RYDIS H68 has the same exact problems getting stuck as the Roomba, but it seems to be worse. The Roomba seems to have a bit more clearance for cords. When my Roomba runs into my Dyson's power cord, it can usually power over them and keep going. So far, the RYDIS has gotten stuck each and every time (with the mopping attachment off or on). It even has this problem with some of my thicker rugs. Also, as far as I can tell, if it can clear the rug, it will try to mop it. This seems like a bit of a flaw in its programming.

As far as noise is concerned, the vacuum is actually significantly louder than its Roomba counterpart. It doesn't seem to have more suction as far as I can tell (neither unit is really what I'd consider a ""powerful vacuum""), so I'm not sure why it makes so much more racket. If you have it just do the ""mop"" function, it's quiet - just the hum of its motor.

For the actual ""mopping,"" I've been underwhelmed. The unit works similar to a steam mop in that it has a reservoir that it pulls water from. This slowly dribbles onto a microfiber pad, which the robot drags back and forth along your floor. There's no active application of the cleaning agent - ie: no jets or nozzles - it's just wet rag on floor. Now this in itself isn't a big problem for me - heck, it's how Mom used to make me clean the floors - but the mapping software seems less than ideal. As I watched my little robot do its ""mop"" function, it successfully went over about 20% of my floor before retreating to its charger and declaring the work complete. When my Roomba would hit a hard object, it would do that ""bounce"" maneuver where it'd tap its front bumper over and over against the object, turning slightly each time until it found a free path. The RYDIS would do this once, discover an obstacle, and then smoosh its bumper against the object at a slightly off-angle, rubbing against said object the whole way. In the entire time I watched it, it didn't really go back over areas it had been either - it'd just make a bee line in a certain direction and turn at a random angle, and wander off into a completely different room. It never came back to the original area.

Again, my house's first floor configuration is far from ideal for these types of robots, but my Roomba does a much better job so far. If you have a simple home with fewer obstructions, the H68 might work well for you. Otherwise, they have a few kinks to work out in my opinion.

**Edit - Aug 3rd, 2014: Malfunction central**

I've been running the Moneual RYDIS for a while now and I've decided to modify my initial impression down from a 3 to a 2 star review. As far as cleaning goes, not much has changed. What made me drop a star was the (mal)functioning of the robot itself. Generally speaking, my Roomba has the day-to-day duties, and I only run the RYDIS when I want a separate wet clean. So far, the machine has a 30-40% success rate when asked to both clean and return to the charger. You seem to have two major options - 1: Clean a tiny area back and forth for twenty minutes, successfully return to charger - or - 2: Clean larger part of the house, get ""lost,"" never return to charger. There are a couple of other options that appear more rarely: Move about five feet away from the charger, get ""lost"" after less than five minutes, end cleaning in error: stopping in the middle of the floor, and the rarest: Successfully clean a large part of the room and successfully return to the charger.

With my Roomba, whenever I find that it's not on its charger, it is generally because the unit got stuck on something; usually cords. The RYDIS seems to just stop in an open area - sometimes far away from its charger base, sometimes less than six feet away in a straight, unobstructed line.

A new and exciting thing my unit has started to do is get stuck on chair legs. The unit crawls to a 30 degree angle or so, lifting its wheels off the ground so that it no longer has traction. Then it just spins its brushes while stuck.  The last time it did this, the unit would no longer respond to any soft commands (ie: you couldn't push the buttons on the unit or the remote). I had to flip it over and disconnect the battery to reset it.",2.0,negative

"Agree, the claim of less than 50% peanuts does not appear to be true. There are certainly more peanuts in each bowl we pour out-about 65%-70%.

Fortunately, peanuts are extremely healthy and a good source of protein. But, the price should be adjusted downward for this high percentage of peanuts.

And what 's so great about sea salt?  Was wondering about that- is it really better?  Enclosed in the Mayo Clinic's review and you can decide. It seems that  may just be a marketing ploy, too.

WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEA SALT AND TABLE SALT?

Answers from Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.

The most notable differences between sea salt and table salt are in their taste, texture and processing.

Sea salt is produced through evaporation of ocean water or water from saltwater lakes, usually with little processing. Depending on the water source, this leaves behind certain trace minerals and elements. The minerals add flavor and color to sea salt, which also comes in a variety of coarseness levels.

Table salt is typically mined from underground salt deposits. Table salt is more heavily processed to eliminate minerals and usually contains an additive to prevent clumping. Most table salt also has added iodine, an essential nutrient that helps maintain a healthy thyroid.

Sea salt and table salt have the same basic nutritional value, despite the fact that sea salt is often promoted as being healthier. Sea salt and table salt contain comparable amounts of sodium by weight.

Whichever type of salt you enjoy, do so in moderation. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium to less than 2,300 milligrams a day  or 1,500 milligrams if you're age 51 or older, or if you are black, or if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.",4.0,positive

"Disappointing! Just opened the sealed bag of filament and tried to print with the blue.  Even at the lowest setting (.4mm) the filament was stringy and would not stick.  Again, I just opened the sealed bag this morning (16 April 2015), so moisture should have not been a reason for the filament to perform so poorly.  I don't know if this one I got was just a bad batch, but it sure is BAD Filament!

Edit #1:  Just to make sure it was not user error, I am testing the filament by printing a Sample file which is included in the Davinci printer. Tried the Yellow color filament and got the same horrible results as with the Blue filament.  Now I'm testing the Red color filament, and when that one is done I'll do the same with the Green color filament.  I will post pictures to show the results of all four colors when all the samples are done.

Edit #2: Finished printing the Davinci Sample file with all four colors.  The Red and Green filament worked flawlessly, but the Blue and Yellow filaments yielded poor print results.  I have included a picture so folks can see the difference.  A shame because two out of four is never a good thing...",1.0,negative

"Wanted a reliable way to test capacitors and inductors. Singstek M4070 works great! It's far more accurate than my multimeter at measuring capacitance and I couldn't measure inductance at all before I got this meter.

The screen is well illuminated and the product is very solidly built. It is a bit toy like in appearance but don't let that fool you, this is a solid product. You turn it on and it just works. You can hear the relay clicking inside which feels sort of cool.

It's very easy to use. It also auto detects what you are testing, messages like ""Small Inductor"", or ""Large Capacitor"" appear above the measured value. It would be nice if it measured capacitor ESR, but at this price point you really can't ask for more.

I must say this LCR meter has exceeded my expectations. I give it thumbs up all the way!

EDIT: well I spoke too soon. I turned the meter on and it can no longer measure capacitance. Now I may have made a mistake as I still had the capacitor plugged into the meter from when I measured it before when I turned it on, but I wouldn't think that should damage the meter. The capacitor is brand new and was only ever unpacked to test with the meter, so there was never any other charge in it other than the one provided by the meter for testing (which should be safe.)

Anyways the meter now goes into this autorange cycle mode and it can't measure sub uF capacitance, as it keeps cycling.",1.0,negative

"I read most and as always I read the negs first.
So far it's one star for packaging and one for the usefulness of the product (at least what I can use of it). Please read:
I really needed this piece to replace a garage window and I didn't feel like getting a glass replacement. The size is bigger than what I wanted which is fine with me.....the problem is, most of it is scratched and the film paper covering it has been ripped away especially in the middle where it's the worst place to be. The packaging was opened upon arrival and the only packing material inside was a small piece of butcher paper. No receipt, nothing.

I'm going to use it for the intended purpose but knowing the middle is scratched up is upsetting and once again, disappointing. I'm not going to contact Plastics 2000 or who ever sent it because it's probably futile. I always have good luck with all Amazon.com purchases and shipping has always been great. You can read my other reviews to confirm that. This time I got a goose egg.

"I bought this carpet cleaner in order to try to get up some of the random stains throughout our carpet, including pet stains and kid spills.

My only complaint is that it didn't work very well on the cat barf cleanup. This was fresh orange cat barf (you're welcome, don't ask me why my car barfs orange), and there is still a slight orange-tinted stain. I have been using Nature's Miracle on pet incidents, like this, which seems to work a bit better. All in all, though, this is a good stain remover for a good price.

"I think the best way to approach reviewing this Scotch Printed Message tape is to look at what it's supposed to do, and then comment.

--Printed with message CHECK SEAL BEFORE ACCEPTING

It does say that. However it doesn't say that in large letters. It's entirely possible for the receiver to not see the letters. They are faint and small.

--High adhesion and holding power resists popping for a secure seal throughout the supply chain

I'm surprised at the fact that this tape isn't stickier. I tried it on a box and I could easily lift it off and reposition.  I put some tape on regular paper and could pull it off without a minimum amount of damage the paper.

--Diagonal lines on tape are impossible to realign if package is opened

It was so easy to pull off this tape and reposition it that I have to doubt this claim.

This is probably the worst review I have ever given on any item.  These trash bags are difficult to separate from one another and are not strong enough to hold but very little weight.  They can be filled about half full of soft items with no sharp corners and very light weight.  Then if handled very carefully might hold together long enough to get them into the trash receptacle.  These were a penny cheaper than my usual kitchen bags so I was keen on saving money.  Hah!  Many bags ended up in the trash themselves when they tore to pieces.

Philips writes in the manual that comes with this thing that one should not use the recharging base from an other model with this unit.  I had another, older unit.  Of course the new brush was purposely made not to fit the old recharger -- planned obsolescence.  But I got it to fit by expanding the base.

"Okay, let me start by saying that the H681 is a sound piece of equipment.  The volume is great and the sound quality is pretty good and I've put several hours on the thing without incident (technologically speaking).  The power switch is also easily accessible while wearing this and the volume controls (though they initially felt backwards to me) are easy to access and press simultaneously for call waiting.

However.

The usability for this headset is completely DESTROYED by the fact that there is no way to swivel the piece to point toward (or at least parallel to) your cheek.  So unless it fits you perfectly from go, you are going to have problems.  Not only will you look like a d-bag for wearing one of these things in most contexts, but you will look like a COMPLETE TOOL because the thing wanders away from your face and sticks out away from your head!  It looks totally ridiculous and is even more frustrating when you throw a pair of glasses or sunglasses into the equation.  Look forward to pushing this thing back toward your head every time you want to make a call.

The simple fact is, instead of making a somewhat adjustable piece to go over the ear, they made it out of a solid straw of plastic.  And that, my friends, has compelled me to go buy one that is more adjustable.  It's a terrible waste, considering the quality of the headset otherwise seems very good.",2.0,negative

"Colgate 2 in 1 Whitening Toothpaste is a fairly self-explanatory product, with one main difference from it's more traditional tube-dwelling counterparts - it is a more viscous gel.

Pros:
 Easy to use container
 Minimal waste
 Fresh smell and palatable taste

Cons:
 Questionable whitening power
 Too large for TSA

This is my go-to toothpaste. I love the consistency, and I love that you can get nearly every bit out of the container without resulting to lots of squishing and folding like the traditional tube.

I haven't experienced much as far as whitening power - I think that nearly every toothpaste these days is whitening, and they are all pretty much equivalent.

"Junk! Ordered this relay July 2015 for a sailboat shorepower/inverter auto transfer switch. Just installed and found two issues! First it hums/vibrates from the 60hz coil transmitting the noise through fiberglass, quite noticeable with everything else off in the boat! Second one of the 30A lugs rivet was loose causing an intermittent connection!

If you can put up with 60hz hum and gamble on QA then this might work for you, otherwise skip it!

One other detail - the rivets are plain steel holding plated copper. Another long term point of failure around saltwater over time. I had already made a Lexan cover but fortunately had not installed.

Now going the manual switch route.",1.0,negative

Reasons:

It holds 100g of silica gel

It has a heating unit that dries it out by plugging it into the wall vs baking in an oven for hours

It has a hanger attachment

The window is easy to see the color of the silica - This unit I could barely see through the dark window to see the color

The construction is much better - This one was almost separating at the edges and pink fluid was leeching out of the sides onto a paper towel once it was full",2.0,negative

"With tomatoes being on the hot list of fruits and vegetables having high levels of pesticides, choosing organic tomatoes is a priority in our household.
When I can't get fresh this brand is one of the best. Not only do the tomatoes taste really fresh and clean, but also the can is lined. Cans can be just as problematic as pesticides when acidic foods are inside.
This particular version is fabulous in lasagna.

 If you Google 'quick pizza crust', you'll find a couple of really good recipes that don't need a lot of time to make. With that pizza crust, and this can, you can add some cheese and have pizza in less time than it would take to be delivered.
And it feels so good to have better choices available for the health and safety of not only you and those you care about, but it's a small part to keep pesticides from poisoning the planet. I do plenty of things and make some buying choices that aren't the best, but even a small step is still a step.",5.0,positive

"Kellogg agreed to remove ""all natural"" labeling from its line of Kashi and Bear Naked products, which the lawsuit claimed contain several artificial ingredients. In addition, they're setting aside $5 million in a fund to dole out 50-cent refunds to Kashi customers and $325,000 for Bear Naked customers. They do not seem to disclose all ingredients and after further research, apparently Kashi is owned by Kellogg and donated some $790,700 dollars to defeat prop 37, GM labelling in CA. The question is why wouldn't they want me to know the exact ingredients, after all I am paying for the product.

The best cereal is muesli and I get that for my friend in organic form. It is the best cereal I could find for her and good enough to be part of a healthy diet.

"I was trying to use this to be able to tell the temperature of a metal component on an electronics project.. and I could only measure as high as 39C. When in fact the component was actually too hot to touch.. and with a Fluke thermocouple I measured over 80C. I tried for an hour (thinking to myself perhaps I wasn't aiming it right).. and doing all sorts of angles and distances with little to no luck.

This isn't the first time this unit has failed to actually show the right temperature.. I suspected it might be wrong, but now I know for sure. The other problem is there is no way to shut off the meter. It goes into standby mode which drains 5uA worth of current (measured with my Keithley 2015 6 1/2 digit bench meter). This is really annoying because I only need to measure temperatures once in a blue moon.. picking up a thermometer only to find its battery drained is really annoying and costly. A physical On/Off switch was I guess too expensive to implement.

So for anyone thinking this cheap unit will work for Electronics.. look elsewhere.",1.0,negative

The black weighed 1.2 ounces more. Problem reported to Amazon support. They might not have any good ones on hand.
This problem has been going on all year from the reviews Ive seen. March 24, 2017 September 1, 2017 July 25, 2017 February 17, 2017 from 9 months ago Amazon comment about leaking (loose lid?) Hello, We've spoken to Amazon on this issue and it has been resolved. Please work with Amazon on a replacement unit. If you have any further questions or issues, I recommend you reach out to our Customer Service Team. 800.624.4320 customer.service@gardnerbender.com
I emailed G B Tech support and this is an excerpt: This failure would be the first complaint we have heard about our liquid tape. And yet Amazon comment on another customer: Gardner Bender Customer Service 3 months ago Hello, Thank you for the information. You should be receiving a full bottle when you make a purchase. Based on your feedback I believe the bottle might've opened a little during shipping. This could've caused it to be thicker and a little dry on the top. If some leaked out this would also explain why the bottle was not full when you received it. If you let Amazon know about this, they will send you a replacement free of charge. If you prefer, you can also reach out to us directly and we'll help you out by sending a replacement as well.

Either the lid is not put on tight or the design of the lid is bad. Shame as when it is good it works better than the other brands I tried.
When fresh this has a nice balance between too thick and too thin as some other brands. I had to repair some burnt wires 4 years ago, in my jeep when the bracket came loose and the harness lay against the exhaust manifold. I put on 4 thin coats letting it dry a couple of hours between applications. I just discovered that the harness has disintegrated because of heat and exposed the wires. The liquid tape did their job as the wires are fine. Bottle had a metal lid.",1.0,negative

"Review for: Extech 480823 EMF Meter

OVERVIEW:
-----------

Measures EMF strength of low frequency (30Hz-300Hz in this case) portion of AC MAGNETIC FIELD (NOT AC electric field, too) from ONE AXIS (direction) in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT).

Because cell phones and microwaves are in a much higher frequency range, this product does not measure EMF (RF) at those frequencies. You would want a separate meter for that.

The Achilles Heal of this instrument is that the design is HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings.  The accuracy is not 4% of the displayed value (+ 3 digits) but rather THE ACCURACY IS % OF THE VALUE OF THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT RANGE (4%x200mG = +/-8mg (+ 3 digits). Since the vast majority of the consumer use of EMF checking is in the single and low teens mG, this is unfortunate.

This will do fine for noting the EXISTENCE of stronger EMF at lower frequencies, but appears to be a highly inaccurate choice for MEASURING it.

MAIN VALUE:
------------

- Measures EMF at 30Hz-300Hz low frequency range (Magnetic AC field only, not Electric AC Field), which covers most EMF generated by AC power in most homes/offices. 60Hz (U.S.) and much of the EMF generated by resulting harmonic frequencies .. 120Hz (2nd harmonic), 180Hz (3rd), 240Hz (4th), 300Hz (5th).

CONS:
------

- HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings .. a fixed +/- 8.3 milligauss (mG). Since most suggested defensive limits for extended exposure are 1mG-2mG or so, this greatly limits its utility. See paragraph above under ""The Achilles Heal of this instrument.."" for more detail.

- Measures only AC magnetic field (mG/uT), NOT AC ELECTRIC FIELD (V/m,mW/cm2, etc.). Adding electric field measurement with decent accuracy would have added greatly to the cost.

NOTES:
-------

- Like other meters anywhere near this price range, the company doesn't claim this unit will filter out <30Hz and >300MHz EMF as well as academic/professional units like the Enertech Emdex II filters out EMF from outside its measurement range.

- This frequency range does not cover cell phones or cordless phone signals, microwave oven radiation, or other high frequencies often referred to as RF (radio frequency).

SAMPLE EMF MEASUREMENTS:
-----------------------------

There is no definitive consensus nor clear epidemiological evidence yet as to how much milligauss (mG) for extended periods could be harmful (within reasonable home/office real world levels). However, there is a consensus from studies that staying under 1mG-4mG would be a good defensive strategy in case 20-40 years from now longer term studies (think smoking, etc.) start showing stronger causal relationships. Most folks who care about this aim for under 2mG, preferably under 1mG, especially where pacemakers can be involved.

EMF METER SHOPPING GENERAL NOTES:
--------------------------------------

EMF FROM LOWER FREQUENCIES:

At LOWER FREQUENCIES we can measure magnetic fields (in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT)), and higher end units also measure electric fields (V/m,W/cm2, etc.). Unlike higher frequencies where magnetic and electric fields are strongly coupled together, at lower frequencies you measure them separately.

As noted elsewhere in the review, for biological exposure it is suggested to play defense and keep prolonged exposure from lower frequency Magnetic Fields to under 1-4 mG (preferably under 1-2 mG) but there is no definitive consensus as to the long term biological dangers, and where the safety lines are.

Regarding Electric Fields of 50-60Hz (AC Power), there is some rough consensus out there to keep below 10-20 V/m and sleep at a spot below 5 V/m, though again opinions vary. 5 V/m was the recommendation in Germany and by the IRPA/INIRC for ""private individuals"", 10 V/m for ""workers"", with 25 V/m for ""workers"" for max. 2 hours. ACGIH recommend 1 V/m for those with pacemakers or other electrically sensitive implants.

The fields in the lower frequency ranges are sometimes referred to as ELF (see chart below for usual acronym meanings of this sort), or even confusingly as EMF which is also often used to define such fields at most frequencies.

EMF(RF) FROM HIGHER FREQUENCIES:

At HIGH FREQUENCIES like those the high frequency meters measure, the magnetic and electric fields are coupled so strongly together that it is one field that is measured, usually in V/m or mW/cm2, etc.

For microwave ovens (2.45 GHz) biological exposure is often recommended to not exceed 5 mW/cm2 (milliwatts per cm squared), however again opinions vary.

Some school or hospital exposure limits for 300MHz-300GHz:
- France, Italy 10 mW/cm2 in schools
- Switzerland 9.5 mW/cm2 in schools, 4.25 mW/cm2 in hospitals
- Belgium, Luxembourg 2.4 mW/cm2

For RF Fields of 900MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 4.5W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.

For RF Fields of 1800MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 9W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.

The higher frequencies are often referred to as RF (radio frequency) frequencies (think cell phones, microwaves, etc.) and thus you'll see some meters with ""RF"" in the title or description.

MAGNETIC VS. ELECTRIC FIELD MEASUREMENT:

AC MAGNETIC FIELDS are much harder to shield than electric fields. On the other hand unperturbed AC ELECTRIC FIELDS are much harder to measure accurately/dependably than Magnetic fields. IEEE tries to help with IEEE 644-1994. The inexpensive models don't pretend to measure this as well as the Enertech Emdex II's of the world, however they are often much less expensive and there's your trade-off.

Note that AC ELECTRIC FIELDS often remain as long as the the source is plugged in, whether it is turned on or off.

So for biological concern, what do people care about, magnetic or electric fields? An engineer in the field that has been following this noted that in the 70's it was electric fields, in the late 70's and 80's it was magnetic fields, and now it's really both. Most inexpensive units are only good for detecting the PRESENCE of stronger fields (vs. measuring them well) and many only measure magnetic fields, and if they do measure electric fields it usually isn't accurate. If you need to measure accurately and/or measure both magnetic and electric fields, I try to help out in this review with some leads later on.

GENERAL:

Meters not designed for it avoid 0Hz since that is the natural ground DC static field and we usually want to ignore that for measurement. Also there is often comparatively little EMF produced 1Hz-40Hz (some European train systems do FYI - 16.7Hz). Thus meters often aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover below 30Hz-40Hz.

The frequency range of 30Hz/40Hz to 300Hz usually covers much of low frequency EMF produced in a home or office. This includes the U.S. 60 Hz AC power frequency and 4 of the harmonic frequencies from that. Thus we usually aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover over a few hundred Hz or so. However, note that capping the upper end of the low frequencies in the low hundreds may fail to capture a good portion of CFL's EMF (compact fluorescent lights) if that is important to you.

Note that measured values can become less trustworthy as you get very close to the source of an EMF field, so measuring practically next to the source is often questionable.

Also note that pulsed EMF is usually not read accurately by EMF meters.

Note that if you need to take high radar frequency field strength into account (think Traffic Control Radar, Aviation, Naval, Military) because say you live near an airport and are wondering .. you'll probably need a meter that reads in the 8.5GHz-9.5GHz range.

Note: I can't imagine who might work so close to one, but keep CFL bulbs without specific UVB and UVC mitigation (think double-envelope eco bulbs, for example) more than 20cm/8"" from people at the bare minimum. If you don't know the technology of your CFL bulb, might as well play defense.

SOME ORGANIZATIONS REVIEWING
EMF/RF BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS:
---------------------------------

Here are some of the more scientific organizations with available EMF/RF research or overviews that might be of interest to you:

ACGIH - American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.
IRPA - International Radiation Protection Association
SCENIHR - Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (European Union advisory group).
INIRC - International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee
ICNIRP - International Commission on Nonionizing Radiation Protection
WHO - World Health Organization International EMF Project
U.S. EMF RAPID Program - 6 year working group put together in the past by NIEHS, NIH, and DOE.
NRC/NAS - National Research Council / National Academy of Sciences by way of National Academy Press
CA Dept. of Health Services - CA EMF Program
IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
VDB - Association of German Building Biologists (Verband Deutscher Baubiologen)

Further future related research discoveries are likely to involve, or at least be reported on, by one or more of these organizations as they have been involved in such research in the past (much of it you can find on the web).

HOW TO GET 3D READINGS FROM
FROM 3 XYZ AXES METER READINGS:
------------------------------------

While some tools take ""3D"" readings, to save money some folks buy meters that read 1 or 3 individual axes, not a composite ""3D"" reading.

To make a ""3D"" reading out of the individual axes readings you are supposed to put each of the three axis meter readings into the equation ""square root (x-squared + y-squared + z-squared)"".

However, here are some short-cut estimations for less demanding needs that some use:

Measurement Value:......Corresponding Guesstimate
1 High, 2 Low values....Use highest value
2 High, 1 Low value.....Use highest value plus half of second highest
3 similar values........Use 1.5x highest value

MEASURING SUGGESTIONS:
--------------------------

Consider/test:
- Keeping unit over 1ft away from any conductive material like metals.
- Putting unit on a non-conductive holder like dry wood or cardboard.
- Reading meter from 5 feet away.
- If measuring over a bed, measuring 2"" above mattress to take pillow into account and lessen the measurement effect of the springs (if there are any, of course).

SOME OTHER METERS:
----------------------

If looking for a high-end, accurate low frequency EMF meter, consider starting your research with these:

(1) ENERTECH EMDEX II
Measures AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields in the 40Hz-800Hz range, 3-axis, 1-2% of value accuracy. Sold to power companies and universities in 50+ countries, this is a leading industry tool. It also has recording, event marking, and software capabilities consistent with the needs of consultants. It is also excellent at filtering out EMF outside 40Hz-800Hz and is unusually accurate in reading AC Electric Field. ($2,950 for base unit)

(2) GIGAHERTZ SOLUTIONS meters
Made in Germany, sold in North America through Safe Living Technologies, Gigahertz Solutions has a wide variety of accurate affordable models that cover many frequency ranges priced from under two hundred to over a thousand dollars. Here are some of them, all these listed have HIGH ACCURACY and measure both AC MAGNETIC and AC ELECTRIC fields:
3030B 16Hz-2KHz ($175)
This model is a value sweet spot for non-professionals, offering most of everything one is looking for in accurately low frequency magnetic and electric fields.
ME3030B Electromagnetic Field Meter
3830B 16Hz-100KHz ($270)
This model extends the frequency range to include a range sometimes controversially referred to as dirty electricity. CFL bulbs, switching-mode power supplies, electronic dimmers, and monitors sometimes fall in this range, too.
ME3830B - Standard Electromagnetic field meter for Low Frequency
3840B 5Hz-100KHz ($400)
The addition of frequency filters for source analysis is the important added feature here, not as much the extension at the lower range.
ME3840B - Semi professional Electromagnetic field meter for Low Frequency
3851A 5Hz-100KHz ($540)
Before the NFA1000 the ME3851A/ME3951 were the models most used by professionals
ME3851A/ME3951 models have data outputs

SPECTRUM ANALYZERS. To measure EMF/RF field strengths AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES you will need a spectrum analyzer. Some consultants use these for higher-end analyses, however there is usually much more expense and skill involved clearly. Below is the maker of an affordable hand held spectrum analyzer solution you may wish to read up on..

(3) Aaronia AG Spectran handheld spectrum analyzer
I suggest reviewing their website for model options if considering these, there is a variety of models and bundles covering different frequency ranges, covering both AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields. The U.S. Distributor is Kaltman Creations (Aaronia AG is in Germany).
- Low Frequency Range Examples:
Aaronia AG Spectran NF-1010E (10Hz-10KHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields, 5% accuracy)
NF-1010E AARONIA Handheld Spectrum Analyzer (10Hz - 10KHz)
Aaronia AG Spectran NF-3020 (10Hz-400KHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields 5% accuracy)
NF-3020 AARONIA Handheld Spectrum Analyzer (10Hz - 400KHz)
Aaronia AG Spectran NF-5030 (1Hz-1MHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields, 3% accuracy)
[Couldn't find on Amazon]

(4) If you are considering spectrum analyzers and money isn't much of an issue you might consider reviewing Tektronix, HP, and Agilent offerings, too, perhaps others, just to know what's out there at the high-end if nothing else. Of course, for most folks this is way out of budget and often skill set.

"I'm a snack fanatic. If it's crunchy, I'm sure to have tried it and probably loved it. If you look at my review for Corn Chex, you'll see that I'm a huge fan of the Chex cereals. And Chex Muddy Buddies (soooo gooood). Chex Mix has all the right components- start with an awesome cereal base, add in the right combo of crunchy accessory ingredients, and BAM - you have yourself a perfect snack! But there's something about Chex Mix that leaves my body feeling horrible after I eat too much of it. MSG (Monosodium glutamate) is not listed as an ingredient...but it does have disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate, which are used in conjuction to replace MSG in products. Some believe these two ingredients have a similar effect as MSG on the body - headaches, irritability, discomfort - and that's been my experience as well. Maybe I'm just sensitive, but for that reason I stay away from Chex Mix. I love the crunch...but I hate the unnecessary ingredients.

"Update: After some extensive use and on my 2nd sheet of this Im changing this from 5star to 2star. Trying to print anything somewhat wide or long in area that also has a 1/2""+ in height will cause this sheet to rip up from the build plate (and your print from the sheet). While you *can* get some permanent 3m adhesive sheeting, that screws up your ability to shim the PEI which is required since none of these sheets are even remotely flat. I estimate variations +/- 1mm will leave you frustrated if any of your prints require precision. Theres no reason they cant make these sheets precise, the tech exists, this is just lazy manufacturing. Im going to look towards solid specialized buildplates since there is no way to have this adhere to the printbed AND be level.

PEI works great with PETG, no heat necessary at ~75f. Its kinda hard to get up thin sheets but thicker prints you can pull right off.

"This stuff smells AMAZING. It smells like lavender essential oil. That being said, if you don't actually like lavender essential oil, this is NOT the product for you. It seems to do a good job keeping clothes fluffy, and I like that it's very concentrated. You only use about a tablespoon for a normal size load. I do NOT like the cap. The cap has the normal screw portion, plus a piece that goes down deep inside the neck of the bottle. I'm guessing this is to prevent extra product from leaking through the threads and spilling. I've seen other brands with similar caps, but this one uses twice the plastic and makes measuring the product odd. The full load measuring line is half of the capacity of the weird lid (i.e.: at the threads, where the weird neck portion SHOULD stop). I couldn't figure out why we were using it so quickly (we don't have THAT much laundry). Eventually I figured out that my S.O. had been filling the full lid and literally using twice the amount recommended. It's too expensive to waste!",4.0,positive

"Once or twice a month we do a family taco night, and these Stand 'N Stuff shells have made that an even more fun event. Unlike the traditional narrow hard tacos, these are wide enough to put all your good stuff in without forcing the shells apart and breaking them.  These really are an outstanding shell.

Why aren't there more than just two damn thong panty liner makers out there?  Any store you go to, there is the damn great wall of pads - but only two teeny boxes of thong-tha-thong-tha-thong (can never pass up a good Sisqo reference).  One of each 'major' brand: [1] Carefree aka the pink box ones (whoah, they totally missed out on branding themselves as 'Pink Box' - good job, Carefree!) and then [2] Kotex aka black box ones (girl, I am NOT going there at all).

Mind you the black box is super snazzy, I dig the design and tend to buy with my eyes because I am a typically female that can see....but I need to remind myself that I will not be wearing the box as a panty liner since said box is in no way absorbent and it will absolutely not alleviate my terrible cramps and nausea by looking at it.

These liners are NOT the winner.  For the first time in YEARS I actually bled through to my choonies.  While that makes me feel all young again, it's def not cool.  This marks maybe the 3rd time that has happened in my 20+ year period career.  Are they barely there as the name suggests?  Yes.  When you pull down your pantaloons to go to the bathroom would they rather stick to you than your undies?  Yes....they're barely there anyways.

"So, these are ""diabetic"" right? So why did you take a TINY little bite size candy and call it a snack bar...even a mini snack is larger than this....and then have 19grams of carbs?!?! This is only diabetic friendly because it is so tiny I can eat a full sized Clif bar and only double the carbs. Yes, calories skyrocket, but lets be honest here...most diabetics don't care much about calories since the carb reduction tends to take care of that for you.

So, since I see that the carbs are sky-high for such a tiny little thing, I expected nice and real flavor. Instead I get chalky and nasty, like most diabetic food. So We gained only in a small 80 calories. We taste a nasty snack. We get MORE carbs than a larger and tastier fun sized snickers bar (9grams).

Yes, you read that correctly. It has MORE THAN DOUBLE the carbs of the larger, better tasting, non-diabetic snack! Heck, a full size snickers, about 6 - 8 of these little things, has only 28grams! Where am I benefiting?

Do not buy.  It tastes terrible, it has more carbs than non-diabetic snacks, it is smaller, and it costs an insane amount compared to snickers.",2.0,negative

As most moms out there, we are fed some things by our Toddlers.. whether we want to eat them or not LOL. This one of those times.. my daughter shoved a big bite of one of her bars in my mouth. Personally, I found them a little dry and (similar to another reviewer), they also tasted a little ""gummy"" to me.

"This Pasta Roni variety,Shells & White Cheddar, is so amazingly good. It tastes wonderful, nothing like many other boxed macaroni and cheese mixes. The white cheddar makes all the difference here.

It has a lot of junk ingredients too but man, oh, man, now and then it is worth the extra calories to dig in and enjoy this cheap and easy side dish. I always look for things that are healthy and low in fat and this really is neither but life isn't black or white. Now and then, I want some good macaroni and cheese and I don't want to spend time making it from scratch. I don't eat this often but I totally enjoy it when I do. Then I diet for two days after!

"I got this the other day. I already own 2 P3 International P4400 Kill-a-watt meters which are very similar in function.
Here's why the TS836A is better:
The display has three lines instead of one. more info at a time. Not well used though...
The plug is lower on the unit and does not block the second outlet of a duplex outlet receptacle
The unit remembers min and max power levels.
The unit has an internal NiMH battery and keeps the accumulated time and KWH and min/max Power info in the event of power failure or just moving the unit.
The unit enables cost per KWH entry to calculate actual cost rather than just KWH
Current is displayed xx.xxx vs. xx.xx for the P4400. One more decimal of resolution. Too bad the current reading is much worse accuracy than the P4400!

Here's why the Kill-a-watt P4400 is better:
smaller size
2% error on current and watts vs 5% error on current and watts for the TS386A (spec was 3% for the TS386A so its out of spec)
Display is easier to read, the segments of the numbers are bolder and much easier to read in dim light and off-angle. esp. when the unit is wall mounted down low.
Individual buttons chose one or two functions only - easier to chose.
The line frequency is displayed with xx.x digits vs. just xx (no decimal) for the TS386A Better frequency resolution is nice if you are using a generator for example.

Ultimately it is a little harder on the TS836A to find the info you want due to the function button having so many functions. The units that show what the numbers are is very small and hard to read. On the P4400 I can just push the button for the function I want and I know what units the number displayed is in.

Picture shows accurately the contrast difference in the displays. (picture here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GZM7RIYIITWK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009MDBU)
Instructions with the TS836A are a little hard to understand. I don't have the P4400 instructions at hand but I don't recall having such a hard time with them.

Final opinion: I think I like the Kill-a-watt a little better.

P.S. 9 months later, The display is dimmed out and all but unreadable. Definitely a loser now. P4400s all still working and much older. Changing my rating to one star!
PPS Its readable but only at a very small viewing angle from straight on which means you can never read it when plugged into a fixed wall socket like its intended.
And by the way, it doesn't have VA (reactive power)  and Power factor of the P4400. something I miss.",1.0,negative

Beyond that, it's not too far off from a household Bissell that can be wall-mounted.

For the size and weight of this vacuum, I was really expecting something like a car wash vac, or at the very least, a lower-end ShopVac that could live on my wall. What I really got though, seems like it was designed to grab Cheerio's out of your child seat.

I'm sure this is really awesome if you have a pristine white garage that you mostly use as a staging area for loading your wheelbarrow, and the worst mess you're going to clean up is maybe a bit of potting soil falling on the floor, or an improperly sealed bottle of Miracle Gro tipped over.

You see... the vacuum really isn't that powerful. Can it grab the dust from my garage floor? Sure. Pick up some spilled oil? Mmmmmmmmm-maybe. Leaves? Bolts? Wood scraps? Not really.

The food looked and smelled good before I put the mixed the cheese packet in.  I don't know if the cheese may have spoiled or something in the original contents.  The product had a strange sweet but sour taste.  Maybe everything was spoiled but I did not think to test taste before adding the cheese sauce.  The food tasted nothing like lasagna but had more of a creamy soupy texture perhaps from the noodles settling for so long inside its container.  I only hope I did not get food poisoning.,1.0,negative

"So far I've tried filament from 3 separate companies, and this has been the only one of the 3 I had problems with.  I bought the Chocolate Brown and the silver, both were wrapped so poorly that it failed prints simply because the filament was caught in the spool and couldn't feed.  But that's not the only problem I had.  I had actually paid someone to create a model for me and I had them do two reworks because the print would fail between 1/3 and 2/3 through - it would start getting stringy and trash the entire print.  I never had this problem before with this printer but I tried everything - cleaning it out, re-leveling it twice, etc.  After their 2nd rework he said there's nothing wrong with the model and suggested that I check my printer, I switched filaments to a Hatchbox spool.  It printed perfectly right out of the gate.  I apologized to the designer, tipped him for his trouble and vowed never to buy filament from this company again.",1.0,negative
"I enjoy Fettucine. I've tried most of the major brands, and some are pretty good as far as flavor and consistency, but DeCecco is the best, especially if you prefer your pasta 'al dente,' or slightly firm. Cooked this way the noodles really shine, with a even consistency and delicious flavor.

You do need to make sure that you stir the pasta as it cooks as the noodles tend to stick together for the first 5 minutes or so in the boiling water. I find that adding a tablespoon of olive oil helps out immensely.

These go really well with homemade Alfredo sauce, as well as simply garlic, olive oil, and your favorite vegetables tossed together.",4.0,positive

"I purchased these knurled knobs mainly for the price. It seemed like all the other ones were much more expensive. I did not even pay attention to the ""lock nut"" in the description. I didn't even know they made these with nylon locking nuts. While I have used nylock nuts on quite a few items where I don't want the nut coming off,  (like on some kind of a pivoting joint) one of the main reasons for ordering knurled nuts to begin with is because they are tightened and removed frequently. A nylon bushing doesn't make sense here, and to me is just a bad design. Not sure what they were thinking.

I just took 0.25 x 20 tap that I happen to have, and got rid of the nylon, but it takes a while, and something I did not anticipate having to do. I like the knobs well enough that I'm not going to bother to send them back, but I think the manufacturers should reconsider the locking part. It's really inappropriate for knurled knobs.",2.0,negative

"I am changing my review---- I will leave the first one below to show my initial response.

After use the heat sensor broke-  It might be as simple as a broken wire.  To my great surprise I was told the heating head was only under warranty for 90 days.  So the most used- most likely part to break has a VERY short warranty.  Not good.  If anything will break first on a machine it is the head and the don't support it.  I have $489 dollars worth of machine that won't work because they won't replace a $10 part. I was fan and supported them and get nothing in return.  It never worked great but FOR THE PRICE it was good enough.  But now it won't work and I'm out.

1st review below before breaking:-------------------------------
Amazing!!!!!- but not for everyone.
I've compared this against $15,000, $1;600, and $800 FDM printers.  For the price, it is unbelievable and has quality equal to the lesser cost ones and 70% of the most expensive machine.
Note the qualification: ""For the price"".
Because this is the first version it is not perfect.  I had to return 1 of these that arrived with issues and fixed the 2nd.  It had bad shipping issues, and without my help would not have worked.  The software has lots of  issues.  The filament has a chip so you must buy theirs, but it is cheap. So to be clear- it has messed up a lot of parts and arrive broken twice.  So why the 5 stars?  Because it makes great parts for 1/30th the price of my other machine. Any 3d printer below $3000 will need similar attention as this one.  I know you don't have to fix a hairdryer you buy from Amazon- but 3D printers are changing daily and that's a reality you should accept or avoid the for now.  IT IS THE FUTURE- but its not perfect yet-

If you have never touched a 3D printer - Wait - till the 2nd or 3rd version.  They need to work out basic design and manufacturing issues.

If you want to play with the future for $500- buy one of these.

XYZ was very responsive to all above issues, and has worked with me readily.  They know there are issues and want to help.",1.0,negative

Worse than the grit size is the smell. I had read the ingredients before I purchased and knew there was grapefruit, but the grapefruit smell was so strong and chemical smelling it's offensive. I have to completely wash the oil away with soap when finished and still am left with an unpleasant chemical smell on my skin.

"I really only wanted the small basket, but since they're only sold as a set I thought maybe I could use the other 2 for something else. When I opened the box to view its contents I was simultaneously amazed and disappointed, amazed at how they work and disappointed at how poorly constructed they are. It's one thing to use thin plastic, but these are so thin that I'm doubtful of their durability. By comparison I have a file hanging plastic box from Rubbermaid that holds about 1000 sheets of paper and I can carry it around without worrying about the paper falling out the bottom. Additionally, although the plastic of these baskets is PP they emit a strange smell that hasn't gone away completely after 2 days of fresh air in my home.

The large basket by virtue of its immense size is not sturdy enough to hold heavy items. The bottom bows out, as does the medium basket, though not as bad. The small basket is the sturdiest of them all, but the poor construction of all the baskets severely limits their usefulness. What I'm most disappointed about is how the individual pieces are connected. The handles have tabs that look like a glob of hardened plastic; they're not uniform in shape, but the holes in the frame itself aren't even round; they look like they were haphazardly burned in with a soldering iron or something that they're too big & the handles thus loose. The same goes for the folding sides, which I noticed because one of the sides just fell out. Upon closer inspection of the tab and the hole I discovered that the holes are malformed. If that's not bad enough, the plastic in several areas look like they were cut by wire cutters so they're not smooth. The edge of some of the side hinges are damaged that they don't properly hook onto the other side at the corners.

Plastic clippings trash and plastic chemical fumes can't be good for the health and environment of the Chinese workers who have to endure this hazardous work so that Americans can enjoy convenience. I'll just use them till they break and try to find a proper way to recycle them. I recommend that you don't buy these at all.",1.0,negative

"One of the stepper motors was hit and broke(it was laying out inside the enclosure), FlashForge internal acrylic plate was shattered inside and some screws were missing. Also, two PLA rolls were included (instead of 1 ABS and 1 PLA).

I know reviews are supposed to reflect the product's performance and one might think this is just a ""damaged in transit"" issue. However, it seems to me this is more a production packaging issue (I saw a couple of unboxing videos where the acrylic Flashforge plaque arrived broken). They stuff the acrylic hood and all other items inside the printer enclosure so save space and when doing so, they put extra pressure on the internal components. That's definitely not the way stepper motors should be packed/treated. This is not a cheap device and it's supposed to be adequately packed.

"I think these are decent grips for $7 bucks.  I did use them on a tough project, and the rubber did break loose from the aluminum frame.  While I never considered these top quality jaws, I just shrugged my shoulders and used an epoxy glue to reattach them much stronger than they came.  The magnetic strip also seems to work fairly well.  Not an incredibly strong magnet, but it does work well.  I wouldn't consider these grips to be designed for very heavy duty work when you really apply pressure to the vise....I'd be worried they may break.  But they work for my general projects.

"I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste.

I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse.  The taste is horrible (you feel like you're rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it's worth it.  Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth.  I'm getting older so I attributed this to age.  The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.

Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication.  I'm miserable.

Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit!

Procter & Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle.  I'm not sure why a company would think it's OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  And that's just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining.  I think I got off easy.

And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  I don't think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I've permanently damaged my gums.

I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.

These are awful, awful products.  Research them, and you'll see.",1.0,negative

"This brand makes the best potato chips. Crunchy, flavorful, all-natural ingredients, light - they almost taste home-made. The texture and crunch of these chips are amazing. And the taste is just perfect. They are high in calories - 150 calories for about 13 chips. One serving, or 13 chips, contains about 15% of your fat. Good news is sodium is low - about 5%. No sugar. 5% carbs. Sea salt and vinegar is a unique combination and blends wonderfully.

So, there's no real nutrition to speak of, somewhat high in calories and fat for a small amount. But for a treat occasionally, 4th of July picnic, why not splurge?

"In my opinion, these gloves are terrible. I bought them to work on my car and other light chemical work. These things constantly tear time and time again. When you try and put on a new glove after a tear it is pretty much impossible since these are not powdered and run small. The moisture on your hands keeps the glove from going on smoothly and you have to wait a minute or two for your hands to dry to put on a new glove. Maybe I got a bad batch, I don't know. I was tearing gloves just trying to put them on.

The gloves fit great and have great tactile feedback so that is a plus but I won't be buying these again anytime soon. If you are a home mechanic then I would look at a different glove. If it is other light work such as wood work, painting and staining then these will probably work well.",2.0,negative

"All of the Krusteaz products we have tried smell wonderful when baking, and their taste meets the expectation that the wonderful baking fragrance sets you up for.  This Honey Cornbread mix is no exception - the bread has a great texture, light but not overly crumbly, and it has a nice hint of honey with a very good corn taste... and this mix is very easy to make. It cooks to a great crisped exterior with a hot, soft interior and we do the following to enhance the end result:

1. Substitute melted butter for the oil

2. Add about 1/3 can of drain cooked corn and fold it in gently

3. Cook the minimum of the suggested time range (which is 22 - 26 minutes). We are at sea level and find that 21 - 22 minutes is just right to maximize the exterior crispness with interior moistness. Any more and the cornbread dries out too much for our liking.

We found Krusteaz products purely by luck; one day we were short on time but had friends coming over, and we wanted to make a nice dessert item that would be good with after-dinner coffee and would make the house smell really nice for their arrival. That product was the Crumb Cake (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krusteaz-Cinnamon-Crumb-Cake/dp/B004IY1MRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krusteaz Cinnamon Crumb Cake</a>) and we were hooked from that day forward!

Since finding Krusteaz, we've branched out a bit to their other products and have found these to really be wonderful too: Belgian Waffle Mix (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krusteaz-Waffle-Mix/dp/B003BQPZGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krusteaz Waffle Mix</a>), Wild Blueberry Muffins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krusteaz-Wild-Blueberry-Muffin-Mix/dp/B00APP0M3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krusteaz Wild Blueberry Muffin Mix</a>), Blueberry Pancakes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krusteaz-Blueberry-Pancake-Mix/dp/B004IXYLQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krusteaz Blueberry Pancake Mix</a>) and the Pumpkin Pie Bars (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krusteaz-Pumpkin-Pie-Bar/dp/B008F8VFBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krusteaz Pumpkin Pie Bar</a>).

"This cleaner has a vacuum in it that is easily twice as strong as Roomba's. It actually cleans the floor.  It doesn't cover the floor as efficiently as a Roomba in that it may miss some places.  It also doesn't have a side brush that gets right up against the wall.  A very missed item.  I have to sweep along the walls every so often to get the dirt out into the room so the Neato will pick it up.
This is an update:
Date is 12/15/14  Ive had this Neato XV-21 for some time now, bought it in Jan of 2013. Used it twice a week in a home of low pile and tile flooring of about 2000 sq. ft. living space. No undue wear and tear in the least.  I loved it when it worked.  Total, I have been through no less than 3 Neato's.  The two extra were sent by the company to me for problems with the units that they could not fix.  The problems are varied: Not being able to find its charging base, a wheel is stuck when it isn't, A new charging unit came in non-working order, battery error 0002 several times and the thing won't budge, does a cleaning cycle and doesn't go back out from its base to finish the job, batteries had to be replaces early, doesn't make it back to its charging base before the battery dies, gets lost,  now the latest thing is ""open my dustbin and turn the switch to ON"".  This advice on its liitle screen is not working the unit it totally dead.  Neato will not take it back even though I have almost been in constant communication with them during all these problems.  Which by the way have gone away from time to time, but usually for no longer than a couple of weeks.

So Im out in the cold.  If I were to do it over again I would not consider a Neato product.  They simply are not made well.  They do clean the best when they are working however.",1.0,negative

PROS: They arrived in ""off the shelf"" condition stuffed in a bag. the handles fit my hands are relatively comfortable enough.

"De Cecco is one of the better brands of Pasta from Italy. Not the best by any means, but pretty darn good.

In Italy pasta is graded with the letter ""i"" (lower case).
In the US, they can call almost ANYTHING Pasta. Major Brands like Ronzoni and Barilla (yes, Barilla sold in this county is MADE in this country with the same ingredients as Ronzoni) are usually half flour.

In Italy, even the WORST grade of Pasta is only allowed to have 3% or less flour.
Real Pasts is 100% Durham Semolina and NO flour.

The Italian ratings for Pasta are as follows:

 Dried pasta with three subcategories 

(i.) Durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semola di grano duro),

 (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and

(iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour. Dried pastas made under this category must be labeled according to the subcategory.

So, first make sure your pasta is 100% Durham Semolina. De Cecco is.

Years ago, De Cecco used Bronze dies to extrude their pastas. that gives them a rougher texture to grab onto the sauce (gravy). They only do that now with a few of their varieties now. That's too bad.

If you want a real pasta that is made from the finest Durham Semolina AND that rough texture because of the dies used to make it, try Cucina Antica. Nice rough surface to hold the sauce and a very high grade of Semolina that you can smell the aroma of when cooking and serving. There are many other high end pastas that have that great semolina taste and aroma and rough surface to hold onto the sauce, but they can cost about ten bucks per pound.

Like I said, De Cecco is a good brand of everyday pasta, but you can also get may other brands from Italy that are about equal to De Cecco (like Anna, Farrara and a bunch of others) for less money. Just check that they are from Italy and are 100% Durham Semolina and NO flour.",4.0,positive

The hand soap I used before just made it worse even though it was supposed to contain aloe. This doesn't make it worse.

"DO NOT BUY!!  I had hoped to use this ""tourniquet"" in my car & ""grab & go"" first aid kit.  It is unfit except for most basic home use.

It is truly a ""Quick Release"" though!  Unless it is exactly positioned correctly it releases on its own!!!  Plastic locking mechanism is flimsy and of very poorly engineered, cheap lightweight, plastic.  I would not trust it to hold unattended and unobserved for 30 seconds!!  It also locks, if you can call it that in a manner that creates ""pinching"" pressure point under the locking mechanism.  The elastic strap is also of very weak material.  As a former Navy corpsman and Marine Corps field corpsman, I do not believe this so called tourniquet would be effective for any but hand or food arterial bleeds.  It is NOT to be trusted stop or significantly decrease any arterial bleed of arm or leg.  It is best described as a quick release constriction band of poor quality and questionable engineering.

"Not nearly absorbent enough for me for overnight. Okay for short term during the day, and maybe overnight with a really absorbent booster pad and a good bed pad in case the booster pad and pull up are not enough. Even with two good booster pads these pull ups are not adequate for overnight if I am very tired. Two good pees without waking up and I will probably have leaked out to the bed pad at least a little bit and by the third time I pee in my sleep the bed pad will be full. If I am really tired I will probably pee at least four times before I wake up. Some overnight pull ups will handle four good pees with a booster pad. These will handle maybe two pees in six hours if I am lucky and using a very good booster pad. If I am well rested, I might wake up after six hours and change my incontinence products. But if I am very tired, I might sleep fifteen hours without waking up at all, and these are useless for anything much over six hours in my experience, at least for a large active person with total urinary incontinence. If you are much smaller or are not active and do not eat and drink very much and therefore do not pee very much, then maybe these will work for you for overnight. Or if you never sleep more than six hours. Or if you are not totally incontinent, but just leak some of your pee and can hold the rest until you was up and get to the bathroom. These are very comfortable until they get full, which is why I gave them two stars instead of one. Also, there are far less absorbent products available, and other products that are too uncomfortable to use at all, so these deserve a better rating than those products. But these products do not come close to living up to the claims made for them, nor do they come close to other products that cost about the same and work much better. And there are other products that cost much less and work as well. So I cannot give them a better rating than a two stars rating. Buy them if you get a very good deal, or are not totally incontinent, or if you get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night to change your protection and want good looks and comfort even if it costs more. There is obviously a market for the product, and if the advertising for the product did not exaggerate so much, I might have given this product three stars, or I might not have bought the product at all, since I would have known that it would only rarely work for me overnight.",2.0,negative
"Pros:  Looks well built.  Printed a few parts before breaking down (one week into ownership)
  Parts that were built looked acceptable for the price of the machine
  Set up and manual are easy to understand.
Cons:  Critical moving parst are not lubricated  (screw axis positioners)
  Failure of extruder connector was immediate and after finally getting someone at Customer Service to respond to me I had several people agree it was a known problem, but they are having a problem getting replacement parts (I am several weeks into communicating back and forth with no luck - I will update review if this gets some positive  attention.
  Bed leveling is very difficult.  Built in firmware has many problems.  For leveling, there are hints in other reviews on Amazon that makes it somewhat easier to get the bed closer to level.  So printing parts is hit and miss.  Some come out.  Some are a mess.
  Having to buy and use their ""cartridge"" filament is expensive and limiting.  Some cartridges ""jam"" (filament, like thread naturally crosses itself jamming).  Because it is enclosed in a case one has to break the case apart and there are differing results (because of a chip in the case) as to whether you will harm the transport mechanism or even the whole machine if you try and fix it per their website instructions.  Very risky.

Customer service (as noted in earlier reviews) much of  the time do not answer their phone during business hours.  When communicating over their messaging system they do not follow up with what they say they will do.  I do not recommend this machine to potential buyers even when they take $100 off the price.

Update: Machine is still ""down"" / inoperable as of 2/14/2015.  Lots of back and forth with ""customer care"" who are having me take the machine apart and send in a part before helping me and not making any assurances as to how long a replacement part will take to get or even if they have them.  I will update as things progress.  Very bad processes.

Update:  2/20/2015  Machine sits idle.  Really bad customer service has a part of the machine in their hands and when I ask if they are going to send a warranty replacement part in their ""message center"" I am given a stock answer of ""when the department involved decides you will be notified"".  I will update if things change.

Update:  2/25/2015  Received replacement part.  Installed easily but caused more problems than I had before.  Calling the customer service number is still a joke as you get ""call back during our hours""  which I and others always call during.  (poor English because I am fuzzy after working 9 hours today on this machine).  I finally got a nice man to call me and spend much time on the phone.  We improved on the filament feed problem but he said one of the sensors may not really be sensing that the filament is there and only after trying to make parts would we know more.  Bed calibration was out (again) so several hours of re calibrating.  Finally able to make a few parts but they were horrible looking.  There are so many bugs and idiosyncrasies neither myself (an Engineer with 40 years experience) OR the nice XZY tech could say anything for sure.  Feeling like a boxer who has taken a beating I am throwing in the towel.  I will still try to get the XYZ to do something but I placed an order today for Lutzbot Mini from Amazon.  Everywhere I researched the reviews were glowing.  Even though I am past Amazon's return policy, I would be grateful if they would take back the xyz printer as it only worked for the first two weeks I had it.  (sometimes)  Even if they only gave me a store credit I would be an appreciative customer.  For now it may become a coffee table.  Please read my review carefully if you have ANY idea about buying an XYZ 3d printer product.  Many, Many hours working on it trying to get it to work and many hours trying to get reasonable responses from their online ""customer service"" message center which most of the time just says ""forwarded to appropriate department"".  Read the other one star reviews for very specific nightmares.

Update (final):  I logged 10 hours yesterday trying to get this machine to work with a part they sent me causing more problems.  Some time on the phone with a nice tech who seemed a bit baffled by the many problems.  I even sent them a photo of the messy part I finally got it to print. Their response was to refer me to the ""helpline"" which does not work. So late last night I pledged that it was my last 10 hours (I have many hours into this mess of a machine and company).  I will write off the $400+ my wife spent on this present.  Late last night I gave the machine to a man who is anxious to build his own from parts that can be scavenged from this nearly new machine.  I again, would, like others have urged, request Amazon to drop it's affiliation with these people.  I post below my FINAL response to them on the ""ticket"" in their system which in total prints out at 21 pages.  My final post is a bit long, but I hope it makes it to this review for you to observe:  ""First off let me express my amazement at how bad a company can handle their business.  And that is significant given that I see a lot of bad moves in the political arena as a Registered Legislative Lobbyist.  But even today, I was somewhat shocked at one of your postings to me on this message link telling me to call the customer help number which is now becoming famous on review boards with its incredibly offensive ""call back during our business hours"" recording that plays no matter when one calls.  And to top it off, another voice tells you to leave a message and press star which gets you nowhere to another message saying something to the effect of ""that mailbox does not exist"".  Do you really not get how many people you make IRATE with that, and all your other ""we forward to appropriate department"" AND ""our policy is...."" nonsense?  And this behavior dates back to sometime last year.  It appears you HAVE NO WILL TO IMPROVE.  One tech I talked to after my first 10+ hours of trying to work the bugs out--- answered my challenge of how bad the processes and top management were with XYZ  -- answered me with what I know is an honest ""You don't know the half of it.""  Exact quote.  Your own people know XYZ is a mess. Take some time COMPANY EXECUTIVES to just read the one star reviews on Amazon (there are tons of them).  Get a feel for how angry and frustrated you make customers when they need you.  The five star people will learn when their units fail.  This machine is so full of problems it is amazing. XYZ is so full of process problems it is amazing.  The business decision not to tell us that a connector is faulty until we have dozens of hours trying to figure out why the extruder doesn't heat is despicable.  I have made a list of other defects that you hide and we finally find out from one of your techs (which are almost impossible to get to) OR from good people who post YouTube information on your problems and possible workarounds.  For me, yesterday was my last ""10 hour workday"" trying to make this thing work.  I appreciated the few good parts I got for the first week.  After connectors fail, bed cannot be calibrated with the present design, and a myriad of other very bad flaws  --  I unplug the machine and will write off the $400+ my wife spent in good faith buying this as a present that worked for a week or so.  I will pursue other avenues.  As I stated in an earlier message here:  ""I give up.""  I do process consulting with companies (I don't wish to take on yours), but I mention that only because I do wish you to experience some kind of epiphany, or self-realization, that SHOCKS you into a dramatic program of quality improvement that (LEAN business practices, Total Quality Control,  Listening to your front line people who know where your messes are) would lead to reverse your course of shoving new products into the marketplace without proper business support processes.

"The concept is perfect- I loathe cleaning out my crock pot. It's heavy and awkward, plus the sides seem to have baked in food that only a brillo pad removes. So enter these bags, the perfect solution. I ordered several boxes of these with a pantry order. Our kitchen has been torn apart for major remodeling since November and my crock pot has seen heavy use.
Unfortunately, I've averaged a 25% success rate with these. The other 75% have leaked before the meal was even done. You'd think this was no big deal but it makes the initial problem worse. The layer of liquid and juices from the food is very thin and burns down to a sticky, awful, burnt film very quickly. Removing the leaking liner is a huge mess. I have to have my husband hold the crock pot over the triple lined trash can so I can quickly remove the soggy mess and not leave a drip trail. This is before I've even served any food. Scrubbing that film off is worse than what I've had to scrub off without the liner.
I gave this two stars because the 1 time in 4 this thing works it's great. The concept is the solution to a nagging problem and I think the product could one day be excellent and a regularly purchased item for me, but not in its current incarnation. Do better, Reynolds, this is a good idea. Meanwhile I'll slog through the remaining twelve liners in hopes of saving myself the hassle of three pot scrubbings.",2.0,negative

"Well made, solid, my opinion?  They could have charged like $30 for the thing and I would have still bought it.  Really nice set up for an AR15.  An additional nice feature is the end cap has its own on / off button for continuious use, unlike others I have bought.  That's a really nice feature.

Update: Well, everything I still said applies, but there is something that's frustrating me. The contact points, other words the pressure points u touch to turn it on and off, runs the full length of the strip. There should have been a dead area at the bottom so that you could use a tie wrap or something and attach it. Why?

Because I haven't had ANY luck finding ANY kind of a double stick tape that will hold this thing!!!

In fact, I'm not sure if there is any good way to attach it without a tie wrap strap. And no matter how low you put it, it will make it come on.

In short, I just don't know a way to do it so I have basically given up and am holding it with one strap at the top and letting the bottom flap all over the place.

The rubbery material is so slimy and slippery that nothing sticks to it. I have wiped it down with alcohol many times but it just doesn't stick. To make it worse, it's not completely flat at the bottom, it's more like a ""T"" (horizontally) so the lower end part is raised a little bit which makes it IMPOSSIBLE to mount this thing flat???

I finally gave up and used EPOXY to hold it, cuz they didn't give any real thought as to how to mount this thing because it should be completely flat on the bottom and designed to take some kind of a sticky!

Very upset because I bought 3 of them and no matter what weapon I try to attach it to, it's impossible unless you use a tie wrap which means it stays on all the time",1.0,negative

"First impressions/experience:
Awaiting an affordable 3D printer, the DaVinci 1.0 seemed like a dream come true. I just so happened to run across this product the day before retail sale in the U.S. I recieved it 3 days later, had a great conversation with the delivery man about 3D printing and how it is now a real attainable thing. I carefully unpackaged the device and got it all set up. Plugged it into my PC and booted the machine. Expecting to see some sort of boot sequence in the display, it was disappointingly dark. Being optimistic, i assumed it was a firmware installation issue. After updating to the most current firmware, still just a dark display. The buttons will result in a beep, the machine goes through a physical boot sequence when turned on, the PC software recognizes that a filament cartridge has not been loaded properly. You must use the physical buttons on the device to navigate the display on the device to load cartridges, configure etc. I certainly hope that XYZprinting will send me a new product paying shipping both ways to remedy this situation. Point being, buyers be wary of buying new products. I will say in the defense of XYZ the packaging and layout of its product is quite nice. I immediately contacted customer service and Amazon in order to remedy the situation. New printer is on the way and review will be updated as seen fit.

Update: I have been working with the da Vinci for a week now and I'm pretty impressed. Keeping my expectations in the 500 dollar 3D printer range, this device is quite exceptional. Sure there are a few layering errors or filament feed problems along the way. However, the resolution of print and overall finished products are not too bad. Only a few minor issues such as a squealy X axis and a heated bed error. The heated bed error is typically after you've printed an object and the machine has gone into stand by mode. When waking the printer from stand by, the machine will load the .3w file and raise the bed in preparation to print. Once the bed is near temp, the machine flashes the 0010 heated bed incorrect temp error. Simply resetting the machine resolves this issue, but you just wasted 20 minutes getting things ready. Since I have shut the machine down between prints the only problem has been that amazon doesn't have any filament! Someone on MAKE has made a reset for the cartridge chip if you'd like to rewind your own cartridges and are tech savvy. Thanks for reading, the da Vinci will be a great starter 3D printer for someone who has no problems with troubleshooting. Hope this info helps, have a good day.

Update 2: Printer has failed once again. This time all is after the warranty on parts has run out. The communication with XYZPrinting's customer service is as flaky as a teenager. Haven't received any help from them at all. Calibrate the heat bed, install new firmware, update the software... Yeah the first 15 emails telling me to do this was quite fruitless. I found out more information on the forums than anything they ever did. So i did some work myself, after extensive testing the stepper motor on the hot end is overheating about 25 minutes into the print. I have now fully voided the warranty splicing the leads for the hot end and removed and tested stepper motor. After contacting customer support a week ago, they told me they would forward my request to purchase a new stepper with drive gear. Still haven't heard back. Nice, build a proprietary machine and not support it. I have since purchased and built a rostock max kit, and will never look back. Looking into using a bearing puller to remove gear and buy a cheapo stepper to work for now. Thanks for taking my $500 and running with it!",1.0,negative

I hate this bag.  It is very difficult to fill you have to hold it open while balancing a container to fill from.  It is awkward to hang.

"This machine is meant to be a plug and play. It prints the demos flawlessly. That is the last good thing I will say about it.
Problems:
1. Support options. There are two forms of support, phone and their web site. The only times I tried to use the phone support, I had to request it on their website and give them a time to call me back. The don't always call back.
The second option is the most obnoxious. You first need to login to the support web page and generated a problem report. So far no different from anyone else. When you get a response you get an email telling you that they have responded to your problem. However, the response is not included in the email, instead you have to login into their website once again to read the response. These communication are not in a forum they are between me and the support person so why do I have to login to my email to read that I need to login into the support site  to read a private response!
2. The first response is always, update your software and firmware if necessary.
The first time I contacted them  my problem was that the printer was printing badly and I tried to use the re-calibrate function  to reset the leveling only to get an obscure error code. and the support person's response was to update my software and firmware. Since I had to hang up from the call because it takes a while to do this. When I got the machine updated and was waiting for a second call-back, I found on the internet that the error-code could mean that the metal corner supports needed to be cleaned.
3. Wiring of the extruder and hot-end. Two times the wire from the controller to the hot-end shorted out. The first time it was because the wire to the connector was not properly installed so over time the constant motion of the print head cause the exposed wire ends going into the connector to touch. Of course due to they horrible support I just went ahead and repaired the connector. The second time, may have been my fault, but was because the wire to the hot-end rubbed against the metal frame holding the extruder and wore through the insulation. On the positive side, the controller appeared to detect the problem and prevented a fire by shutting the print down and displaying an obscure error message.
Finally, the control wires to the extruder shorted and burned up. This was the last straw, I gave the piece of crap to an intern to get it out of my shop. I will never buy another Xyz product and will make sure that all my associates are aware of the poor quality and support.",1.0,negative

"Among my favorite Izze flavors, and one of the only drinks that tastes good even after sitting out and losing its carbonation.
If you were curious: it tastes just like juice. But that's because that's what Izze is: carbonated juice with more sugar than usual, but with a crisp, refreshing taste.
I started drinking Izze in order to quit Coca Cola, and it worked for a while -- until I ran out. I don't plan to buy on a regular basis, primarily because it's overpriced  -- felt like I should have gotten more than just four cans. However, it does make a nice occasional treat, and I would recommend it as more of a fridge-spicer-up than a beverage staple.",4.0,positive

Right away I recognized the surprise tanginess of the cheesy tuna. It tasted quite sweet to me. But it doesn't have sugar! Kids will probably go crazy for this food once they get used to it because of this taste.

I think this is much better for kids than the foods most of them normally go for such as the average plain pizza or potato chips. I also think this is made for kids by design, and appropriately.",5.0,positive

"A light and easy to prepare side dish that won't set you back financially.  I often turn this side dish into a main dish by adding shrimp, canned tuna, or chicken breast and some diced vegetables (tomato, asparagus, broccoli, peas, corn), whatever is handy at the time.  It works well when you have a small serving of vegetables left over from the night before which wouldn't be enough for two people, but is too much to throw out (we are empty nesters).  It is easily changed from it's basic flavor to a more robust one by the addition of your favorite spice or herbs.

If I had to nitpick, my only criticism would be the decision to list the nutrition info based on 2.5 servings.  Seriously?  How is that helpful for anyone other than maybe a couple with one young child who would eat that half serving?

"This is my first experience with printing in ABS, as the maker space that I go to doesn't really let anyone use ABS--as we're still on the Replicator 2 and that printer doesn't handle ABS. And our delta printer was down. I used this filament on my own personal printer which is an Ultimaker 2. Overall, I had a really hard time in getting the filament to stick to my build plate and read online about making ABS slurry which is super smelly and totally a hot mess. Another user suggest that I spray hair spray on my build plate instead--which is simpler and much much easier.

Overall, I did managed to print through most of this roll but here are some out standing problems--the filament snaps/breaks apart a lot--I had to take apart my feeder because this filament breaks apart in there a lot! I also the printer head now looks yellow--the fumes for some reason have a yellow coloring which has now ""dyed"" my printer head a strange shade of yellow. Also because this runs hotter than PLA I now have to replace the PTFE coupler on my printer head. I'd say avoid this material if possible or try a different ABS filament manufacturer.",2.0,negative

"I always crave salty, crunchy snacks with a little kick to them, so I thought that these would be perfect. Unfortunately, they were a disappointment. I like the chili lime flavor- the citrus and spice are a great combo and very well balanced, but it was the texture that I didn't care for. Instead of being crunchy, they're rather soft, almost like they're boiled rather than roasted.

Instead of devouring these within a day, as I usually do, they've been sitting in my kitchen cabinet for a few months.",2.0,negative

My daughter would give this 5 stars, but I'm taking away a star because I don't really like this...so far. I've enjoyed other flavors. I can always give it to my daughter, so it won't be wasted. I'll update this if there's any changes to my opinion.",4.0,positive

Printer used: Makerbot Replicator 2X

Nov 2015 update: Recently I've had issues with the consistency of this filament and now it WILL NOT print past the first 30 minutes of the build. I've tried everything to get it to print (temps 210, 230, 250), different print speeds (30,60,90), but alas nothing worked. What really is annoying is that I was printing really well with one spool of this filament and then it ran out. When I replaced it with a new one right out of the bag it doesn't work.

"Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.

"My green 30 micron sheet came with a lump in it. Light blue and pink were also creased so badly in the package I couldn't use the middle of the sheets.

The package itself is creased in half, which weakens the paper so you had better plan on using halves instead of a full sheet.

For that reason, these sheets are annoying. I'd rather pay $3 in store for the pack, and get the sheets flat where I can see them beforehand.",1.0,negative

"Im very disappointed in this pita chips. I wish I would've never tasted it because It was one of the worse experiences I ever had with food. Im not sure how it got so many good reviews but everyone has different taste what taste good to some people might not taste good to others.
This bag wasn't big either in my opinion its very small to be party size compared to other brand of chips. I was only able to take a bite out of one chip and ended up throwing the rest away.

I didn't taste the garlic or parmesan or any flavor it claims to have. THERE IS NO TASTE!  Also the texture of this chip is very and I mean VERY HARD. I had a hard time chewing it that's how hard it is. Its annoying because normally I don't buy brands of chips I never had before but looking for stuff on amazon is a hassle, time consuming and ANNOYING. I
 didn't see all the other choices until after I placed my order and it was too late. I really think amazon needs to do better with setting up the pantry to make it easier to buy and find items. Bottom line is I will NOT buy this brand EVER again, they are so hard to eat im going to throw the rest of the bag in the trash. They have nerves to sell these chips at 5 dollars, Im not sure how much I paid but this is definitely not worth 5 dollars. They made the bag look fancy and expensive but the taste and quality is POOR.",1.0,negative

Bits of nut skins covering the nuts gave a very dirty appearance although they didn't affect the overall taste. The nuts didn't have a 'fresh' taste and came across as a bit stale.

"Started using this after the brand I was using became soooo expensive especially in smaller sized bottles.

Plus we do most of our meat cooking on the grill of our Jenn-Aire range.  Seems to work just as well in the large outdoor deep fryer and couldn't tell a difference in taste between the previously used brand and the Planter's in the deep fried turkey.

"We had been buying Kirkland's mixed nuts and decided to try these. I found them a little too salty, although I'm glad they use sea salt. I also didn't read the print and see that peanuts were just under 50% of the nuts. The other nuts are almonds, cashews, brazil nuts, hazelnuts and pecans.

To be five stars for my taste, I'd lower the salt to 2-3% instead of 5% - then you could taste the nuts flavor better. The salt overpowers the different subtle nut flavors in here and they all taste about the same: salty. And I'd lower the peanut content to perhaps 30%, if possible. Might be fun to include some macadamia nuts in here, too.

If you like peanuts and you like salt, however, these would probably be a 5-star treat for you.",4.0,positive

This was easy to make and it turned out great. My family really enjoyed this product and we will be using it again in the future.

This was the first time I had ever considered using online shopping for any of my food. Amazon Grocery had a pretty good selection of dry supply items. Everything that I ordered came nicely packed and wasn't damaged at all. These items where very easy to make and they all tasted great. When I made this purchase I had a coupon for $25 of on an order of $75 or more. It was really nice that Amazon kept track of how many items you had in your box and how much space was left. Each item also showed how much space it would take up in the box, so you had an idea of what else might fit in the box. After I had the box completely filled I simply checked out as usual and a few days later it showed up at my house

Overall these items where great and I will be ordering again in the future. What a great way to get your shopping done with out leaving the comfort of your own home.",5.0,positive

So beware, level 5 is a full 2 1/2"" longer than the level 4. It is not a regular length as it is mentioned on the package.

This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity.

"I purchased this printer from the compnay only a few weeks ago. I have to say it has worked ok, but not for the price level it is at.

The printer is pretty. It fits perfectly on my desk. The fact the filament fits into the receticles on the side is a plus, as it cuts down on the maount of filament spools I have to mount. The print quality is average. I have not tried it at 70 microns yet, but 200 is comparable to all the others I have worked with.

The wifi card inside will not connect to my Comcast Business class router. The company syas it is because the card is a 802.11b card, and my router is an N. Doesn't make much sense since I confirmed my router is a b/g/n router, but none the less they said only to use the AD HOC feature, which is a fail on their part.

The filament is incredibly expensive. I ordered some this week. I loaded it Thursday afternoon and started a print (Frankenstein light switch plate). With a normal filament spool I get from a 3rd party, I can do about 20 per spool. But here, I was only able to get 6 prints done before it was reporting that the spool was out of filament. That translates to about $10 of filament per print, which is insane. But you have no other options. The filament has to be in the proprietary holder and attached.

This printer is a good printer for someone looking for an easy to use printer that they are going to use sparingly, that is if you don't mind the price tag. There are other printers at the same price range that accept 3rd party filament and do as good a print job as this. I would avoid this printer if you are looking for something on the ""prosumer"" level and doing a small business from it.",2.0,negative

"I already own two utility carts - both two shelf models - and I was hoping this three shelf model was going to be a welcome addition to my workshop.  Wow, was I wrong.  After briefly attempting to assemble this Luxor cart, and encountering what I thought was a poorly manufactured cart due to poor part quality and fit tolerances, I then went back and read some of the reviews to see if anyone else had the issues I did. I found one reviewer touched on the lack of sturdiness of the shelves and the build quality - but nobody touched on the fact that the leg posts do not fit into the shelf posts!!!  Huh?  Did they change the design of the parts recently?  DId I get a lemon?  How could I be one of the very few to encounter this?

First, a little about the two carts I already own - one is a WEN model, two shelf cart and one is a Husky cart, which is also a two shelf model.  These both were purchased from Home Depot - the WEN for $69 on sale (normally $99) and the Husky for $89.  The WEN cart looks exactly like the Harbor Freight $99 cart - and after further inspection I found out it is... although it is not a bad cart - I like it better than the HD Husky cart.  The main thing I do not like about the two Home Depot carts - only two swivel casters and NO locking casters - which is a pain in the rear on my sloped patio as I constantly battle the loaded cart toodling down the slope....

So you can see from the two carts I already own that my expectations were not through the roof - the two carts I own are sub-$100 carts, and I look for something that is built sturdy that does not carry a high price tag.  It is not like I was comparing this cart to $500 carts that are made of stainless steel - I weighing my inputs against two HD carts that I got for $69 and $89 respectively, and carts made of plastic.  Keep that in mind when reading here - this is NOT my first cart, and my expectations were NOT too high.  Also, this review is only my opinion, others may beg to differ, and I respect that.

Now, back to this Luxor cart.  Upon opening the box, the first thing that struck me was the ""thinness"" of the shelves.  Compared to the two other less expensive carts I own, the shelves are a lot thinner, and flexed with the slightest side pressure.  OK... I initially did not fret.  I was still looking forward to the fact I had four swivel casters, two that locked.  Well, I never got that far.  When I turned the first shelf over to install the posts, I was horrified first at the thin leg post material, and the cheapness of the plastic used.  They are square / channel designed legs, but made of VERY thin plastic, and very brittle plastic in addition - in my opinion.  But that was not the worst part - what was the real head scratcher was THEY DID NOT FIT INTO THE SHELF posts. I played with three or four of the legs posts on three or four different shelf posts, to no avail.  To make the leg posts fit, I would have had to file down the shelf post part... or force them on with a mallet, which would damage the receiving part of the shelf, and gouge out the plastic.  I refused to do that 16 times for the 8 shelf posts!!!!  They should fit, and if there was a concern about them being too loose, they should have designed them with a screw, or nut and bolt system!! If I attempted to force the legs on, it would peel back pieces of the shelf post, and I did not want to go any further.

Note that this cart is designed with ZERO screws, bolts, nuts, etc.  NONE.  On one hand some might like that, but with this cart and the way it turned out, even if I did want to keep this cart, that was a minus.  Given the cheapness of the plastic used on the leg posts, there could be nothing but problems down the road.  The thinness of the leg posts, and the cheapness of the plastic simply does not add up to making a press fit design.  This cart is simply NOT made to last.

At this point, I have described enough to paint the picture of my thoughts on this cart.  I never went past Step 3 on assembly.  I will stick with carts that are designed with thicker / beefier / sturdier parts, and ones that employ screw, nut and bolt hardware to hold it together.  I cannot believe this cart was more expensive than the two I already own...

As a side note, when I went back to HomeDepot.com, I noticed a three shelf cart under the label ""H Wilson"" that was the EXACT same cart as this one - the picture was the exact stock picture, with the same specs.  HomeDepot wanted $129 for this same cart... so obviously this cart is made in one factory, then marketed by more than one brand / company with different labels.  Says a lot to me.  I know that most carts are mass produced these days, but I will stick with the ones that are better built for my needs.

The pictures, description and reviews fooled me on this cart - what I thought I was getting and what I got did not match in quality in the end.  I am shocked at all the positive reviews for this cart... but again everyone's needs are different, YMMV, and I respect your assessment of this cart could be different.  Please return that sentiment....

Thanks for reading.

EDIT:  I did not mention this in my review above, but I did return this cart, and labeled it as ""defective"" since I could not get the leg posts to mate with the shelf standards without damaging the part or doing some major filing / modification.

EDIT 2:::  After reading other reviews - some that say how easy this cart assembled - I have to assume that the company changed the design of the cart, as the one I received did not go together easy at all - not even close.  I am a woodworker, an engineer and work with my hands all the time.  What follows is not a review written by someone who rarely assembles things, quite the contrary.  But I had to write the review for the product I received, and call it honestly.  I know some may not like that, but it is what it is...

... if the company has since addressed this design / assemble issue, then that is a good thing.  And if my review had anything thing to do with that, then that is also a good thing.  But if the reviews written before mine that state how easy this cart assembles are true, then the only conclusion I can come up with is a design change somewhere along the way.

"I have never once been able to successfully use regular plastic wrap, so Press'n Seal is a miracle product for me. Finally, something that actually does stick not just to itself but also to all kinds of kitchenware! Aside from sealing dishes and such, I have used this to wrap loose pieces of food and even to cover a wet paintbrush and pan so I could take a break from renovations.

So why one star off? It's because of the completely awful cutter blade on the box! Apparently someone on the Glad legal team has decided an effective cutter is far too dangerous for the average person to handle safely. The blade is flimsy, clear plastic, barely extends past the edge of the box, and gets bent out of shape after a few uses.  Most of the time I end up using scissors to avoid shredding this wrap on the terrible cutter.",4.0,positive

"20 Count Frito Lay Variety Sack, Flavor Mix, is a mix of your favorite Frito Lay flavors!  And just a snackin' amount so you don't over do it.
 My kit had 3 (three) LAY'S Sour Cream & Onion Potato Chips, 3 (three) LAY'S Barbecue Potato Chips, 4 (four) CHEETOS Crunchy Cheese Snacks, 3 (three) DORITOS Spicy Nacho Tortilla Chips, 4 (four) DORITOS COOL RANCH Tortilla Chips, & 3 (three) FRITOS Chili Cheese Corn Chips.  All of these are 1 oz bags.  Granted, these thing are great for you, or me, or any one for that matter, to eat, but some times you just get that hankering for throw back snacks from your youth.  That is what is perfect about this variety pack, you have just enough in each bag to satisfy that craving, with out eating too much and destroying your insides.  I bought these specifically for a summer party get together.  I like to provide all finger food when hosting in the hot weather.  I provide foods that can be eaten with fingers to prevent me from having to dirty silver ware, or buy plastic ware, both of which are a waste.  By going with this variety pack, my guests have plenty of options, and whatever is left over I can stash for future cravings and they don't go stale!  These can be great for trips with the family, parties, to go stuff, picnics, etc.",4.0,positive

"I have bought this many tines but never on Amazon.  The oats are always fine, a reliable brand, and the price was average.  I can't rate the quality of this particular one though.  I made the mistake of ordering a couple of boxed food items with some other supplies in Prime Pantry.  I usually don't do that but I have always been happy with Amazon packing and shipping.  Unfortunately there simply wasn't enough packing material to keep items from tipping over and shifting around and glass cleaner tipped over onto the oats and leaked.  And I don't understand why the oats weren't placed in the other side of the divider with the other box of food which suffered no damage.  Personally I don't think Amazon should allow us to order chemicals and cleaning supplies together in the same box as food items.  I know I won't do it again and take partial responsibility.  I did file a packing complaint and I threw out the contaminated oats.",4.0,positive

"You need a PROPER dust hood-especially if cutting lead paint. I believe silica-in cement-is a carcinogen too. Do not take a chance as this creates a huge dust storm. I used a 3M NIOSH mask and goggles- both a must, to grind old loose paint off a basement wall for waterproofing and painting. Incredibly difficult job with great results-short of my soreness.

I used a 7""Dewalt grinder and the DustBuddie hood- bad combination, really bad. Diamond wheel recessed in the hood too far and the diamond tool ate the brush on the hood. Huge mess and the hood failed. I contacted Dustless Technologies and they sent a new dust buddie and a shaft-extender- also a bad plan. Shaft extender was eccentric and 3weeks later my shoulders and hands still hurt. No kidding, still have a blister. The hood barely worked, the bearings in the grinder are probably ruined and I nearly choked to death toward the end as the second Dust Buddie rattled to pieces. It was a job I HAD to do by a certain date, so fought through it. Diamond tool and grinder were great-dust Buddie did not.

Do not try this before verifying an un-modified grinder shaft fits your vacuum hood.",1.0,negative

"I was encouraged when I received this toothbrush.  Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.

My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife's mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a ""clean"" mode and a ""sensitive"" mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.

Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.

The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.

Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars.",2.0,negative

"I agreed to test a bottle of this shampoo because of all the review that basically state ""My hair fell out!"" I'm a 45 year-old man, who pretty much keeps his hair buzzed at Curly-from-The-Three-Stooges length, which drives my wife crazy. I thought this would be an interesting experiment, since I really don't care about my hair, and I had hoped that the results of this experiment, which would see me laying my hair on the line for the betterment of all humanity, could perhaps be my way of creating a lasting legacy of service to mankind that my children and grandchildren could be proud of.

 Alas, it was not to be.

 After nearly a week of using the shampoo on a nightly basis, on my head AS WELL AS MY BODY (I'm half-Italian...I tend to be on the hairy side.), I had no hair loss, no rashes, nothing. In fact, it was making my hair, which I had been growing out in hopes of getting better results,  shine. I could probably have milked another week or so from the bottle, but then my wife, who I had not informed about my plan, decided to research the shampoo herself, with a eye towards using it (Despite my request that she NOT use it.....), read these reviews, and POURED THE LAST THIRD OF A BOTTLE DOWN THE DRAIN.

 Thanks a lot.

"Let me start this by saying I use a high volume of filament for my business. Because of this I have tested many different brands of filament to attempt to find ""the one"" perfect filament. I saw IC3D's filament as a good American made product that I could stand behind. That is, until I got it in the mail

Right off the bat, the filament was sealed in the box, but I noticed inside the wrapping the spool was covered with dust. Dust and a 200+C hotend do not mix. So I took the spool and blew it out with compressed air next to my HEPA filter to keep it from blowing around the room, and decided to give it a shot...

Don't ask me how they achieved this, but when I print with this black there are spots of matte finish, and spots of gloss. I have never in my 3D printing career seen this happen with even the cheapest Chinese filaments. Also the dimensional accuracy is definitely out of spec on both of the rolls I purchased, which makes my Ultimaker 2+ very cranky and constant adjustment of the filament feeder is needed.

So, aside from the jams, the patchy finish, and poor QC, this filament is almost as good as the chinese equivalent, and costs 50% more! What a bargain...needless to say, I will not be purchasing from IC3D again. Use at your own risk",1.0,negative

Bright 'sunny-day' daylight is needed to see things well with this camera, and in a tight, semi-dark spot, its useless. Also the end with the camera is as big as a persons thumb. Ironically, the camera inside is no bigger that the nice thin cable, but the brass piece is just too big for its own good.

To make a long story short I could not even use their crappy PLA in their printer because it had a different chip.  Oh well.  I have since become fed up with the whole thing and tossed the printer into the recycle bin as well as the unusable PLA.

"We have been using various ""natural"" peanut butters for years, switching as soon as we learned about the dangers of partially hydrogenated oils. ""Natural"" is the industry code word for no hydrogenated oils, and we always look for it because even ""reduced fat"" peanut butters have hydrogenated oils if they're not labeled ""natural.""  We've tried so many brands over the years, including Skippy which tends to have slightly more saturated fat than other natural blends.

As a family we tend to prefer the more boutique brand, Peanut Butter & Co. Among the basic go-to brands, we agree that Jif Natural has a more robust roasted peanut taste. This Skippy seems a little bland by comparison, although it has that same classic Skippy taste, meaning we detected no real difference taste-wise between this natural version and the regular (hydrogenated oils) version. Per a two tablespoon serving, Skippy Natural has 3.5 grams of saturated fat (other brands have 2.5 or 3 roughly), and 3 grams of sugar. We found that the Skippy Natural with Honey (5 grams of sugar) tastes better all around.

Skippy Natural may never be our absolute favorite peanut butter brand, though it does offer a recognizably pleasing peanut taste, no hydrogenated oils, and a good value compared to more boutique natural brands. If your family is thinking about going ""natural,"" at least with peanut butter, Skippy is worth a shot.",4.0,positive

"I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste.

I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse.  The taste is horrible (you feel like you're rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it's worth it.  Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth.  I'm getting older so I attributed this to age.  The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.

Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication.  I'm miserable.

Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit!

Procter & Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle.  I'm not sure why a company would think it's OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  And that's just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining.  I think I got off easy.

And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  I don't think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I've permanently damaged my gums.

I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.

"This filament is cheap - and it is cheaply made.  I have printed with a couple rolls - both were very tangled - repeatedly jamming from tangles on the roll that were so bad that they would stop feeding.  Once you used a third of the roll the tangling was less - but then the crumbly spots started.  Each roll had spots that were so dry and crumbly that the filament would break as it tried to feed.  You could just crumble it for a foot or two, it would break to bits when gently squeezed, it didn't feel like any normal filament - and then the filament would return to normal flexibility.

Someone told me that it was rumored to be mislabeled PLA and not ABS - a plastics expert told me to burn a little and if it smoked it was probably ABS while if it smelled sweet it was likely PLA, and it both smoked and smelled sweet.

It prints at ABS temperatures - warps and shrinks like ABS, and I got a couple great prints out of it.  I printed a T-Rex head and it didn't break during the print and looked great - then I couldn't print the mounting stick without warping.  I printed a twisted star vase using a vase slice, and it came out waterproof.  But I had prints fail because of crumbling and others failed because of tangling.

If I had to guess I would guess that it was a blend of plastics, maybe poorly sorted recycled plastic.  Not worth it unless you don't care that some prints fail.",2.0,negative

"I bought these to replace a box of painters gloves I had been using for light yard work. The other gloves would tear in the finger area after about 10 minutes. But I was done by then so no big deal. The toughest part with these gloves is getting them on without tearing the cuffs.  That must be why they come in packs of 100?!?  They fit tight in the finger area and loose on the cuff. That means debris from whatever you're using them for will fall into the palm area. Unfortunately just gentle use on non-rough surfaces caused the palm area to tear. Within a few more movements the fingers tore as well.

Today I tried a pair on again to pick up some small twigs and they literally tore apart at the palm by me simply flattening my hand out. I then put another pair on and a small thorn on a twig went straight through and cut my finger. I guess that answers the question about punctures.

Any glove that tears this easily by standard hand motions would make me uneasy about trusting them for anything medical. I now feel really cheated as I could have replaced them with 100ct painters gloves for only $4.",1.0,negative

"I bought this because it seemed extremely inexpensive, and I see that it was for a reason.
I will go through the products one by one:
Mascara- there is a black side and a brown side. Neither give any sort of volume or definition, it just kind of clumps up and sits there. The wand is short and stubby, not long enough to add definition at all.
Eyeshadow- These eyeshadows LOOK nice and the color payoff looks great initially, but once you put them on you see that they don't last long at all, even with an eye shadow primer. The shadows crease and seem to just fade away during the day, no matter what I have tried.
Eyeliners- This comes with two eyeliners. One is black and one is like a highlighter color. The highlighter color provides basically no payoff at all, and the black liner simply smears and bleeds, doesn't last at all.

A couple of the grommets were pitted on the margins, and one of the male components was bent.  Two more set imperfectly and had to be removed, a problem which I haven't encountered elsewhere.  I finally got around to weighing the respective grommets and found the General submission to be roughly 30% underweight.  Brass foil.

They taste good but just aren't ""kettle"" enough.  If Lay's had billed them as ""small-batch"" or ""old-fashioned"" potato chips I feel it would have been more accurate, but then I might not have bought them.

This set-up has worked flawlessly for the past 1.5 years using HB to produce the same part I print all of the time on it. Being that HB increased 50% for no reason, I thought I'd give this a try. Nope... Keeps popping off, keeps warping, changed up and down from 220-250 for extrusion, change up and down from 80 -115 for the heated bed. First layer is amazing, even added extra brim and mouse ears. No luck. Guess I'll pay more for something that works.

"I posted a ""5"" in my review right after buying this product, and was happy to do so. I'm changing it to a ""1"".  This is why.

I ordered this product December 14, 2014 for my brother and mother. It quit working December 2015, but my brother did not tell me it wasn't working.  By the time all the craziness of Christmas slowed down and I was able to take time to look back to see when I ordered the vacuum, I found out the vacuum was out of warranty as of January 5.  Today is January 7. The LCD screen is blank and it won't work.  I tried an online chat but no one responds when I click on ""chat.""

I am VERY disappointed in Neato.  I have a Neato, too -- actually I have two, models XV-15.  My Neatos are having problems too and will no longer work, either.  I haven't looked back to be sure but they're less than a year-and-half old if I remember right.  I had to replace the batteries in both of them at about 6 months, not a small expense but I liked it so much I decided I'd just do it and pretend it was the price of an inexpensive housekeeper.

When the Neato works -- it is a really great vacuum. I was so impressed when I got mine that I bought another plus one for my brother and another for myself in our two-story home. I told everyone I knew about how wonderful the Neato was.  I know of two people who bought a Neato, too, based simply on my enthusiastic recommendation.  Now I regret my endorsement.

One of my Neatos has now quit, too.  Because I didn't know my brother's Neato was no longer working, I thought it might be a fluke.  I bought another.  The replacement didn't work, either,, right out of the box. I called customer support who was no help at all.  They did give me permission to send it back and sent a replacement, in good time. That one isn't working either from the first charge.

I used to be a thoroughly enthusiastic evangelist on behalf of Neato, even showing people how wonderful it was when they came to visit. But I'm so disappointed now in how long the Neato lasts, how long the batteries last, and the problems I've had that I will again tell people about my experience -- but this time the free advertisement will not be good.  I hate being taken advantage of and think the company is taking advantage of people when they don't fix known issues and service is not a priority when there are problems..

I will let my experience be known in order to protect other people from my experience. I believe I have ample experience to post a qualified negative review -- I'm talking about five vacuums, counting the two that came and didn't work at all. (and yes, I know how to set it up and properly charge, etc.!)

Bottom line?  The Neato vacuum does a WONDERFUL job --  when it's actually working.  But the online help, the phone service, and the reliability of the vacuum stinks, big time.

I really liked my Neato. Very much.  But now my advice to others is AVOID THIS VACUUM.

If the above mentioned problems are ever resolved by the company, I'd happily become a customer again.  But I don't know how I'll ever know, since I won't risk another purchase. The trust is gone and I've come to believe the company doesn't care or it would fix the problems (do an internet search for customer reviews if you want to verify my comment about on-going problems).

Again, sad to say, don't make this purchase. I truly believe you'll regret your purchase, if your experience is like mine and so many others who have posted in customer reviews..",1.0,negative

"Colgate 2 in 1 Whitening Toothpaste is a fairly self-explanatory product, with one main difference from it's more traditional tube-dwelling counterparts - it is a more viscous gel.

Pros:
 Easy to use container
 Minimal waste
 Fresh smell and palatable taste

Cons:
 Questionable whitening power
 Too large for TSA

This is my go-to toothpaste. I love the consistency, and I love that you can get nearly every bit out of the container without resulting to lots of squishing and folding like the traditional tube.

I haven't experienced much as far as whitening power - I think that nearly every toothpaste these days is whitening, and they are all pretty much equivalent.

I recently started traveling a good bit, and I am disappointed that this container is too large for TSA, and does not come in any smaller sizes.

Overall, this is my favorite toothpaste, and I don't think I'll be switching anytime soon.",4.0,positive

"Wheat thins and triscuits are my all time favorite crackers! What I love about wheat thins though is they can either be eaten standalone, which is how I normally eat them, or with toppers such as cheese, which I have on occasion. Triscuits however, are on the dry side, and while you can eat them on their own, I most always eat them with cheese. I find wheat thins to have a nice, sort of nutty, flavor, and has just the right amount of salt, which like a lot of crackers, is just on one side. I love all things salty, so when I eat them, Im always trying to make sure I get the salt side down so it hits my tongue. Doing it this way hits my taste buds in all the right places as I eat each cracker. And the cracker is just the right size to pop the whole thing in your mouth, so if the salt side is up, I can easily flip it down with my tongue before I begin chewing it. Maybe its part OCD, but hey, what can I say, its how I like to eat them! :)",5.0,positive

Unfortunately, this microwave comes with a few annoying features.  The hardware tolerances are a bit too coarse, and the door fit, and the body molding, tend to be mismatched in different places.  The door latch makes a huge sound when opening and closing, and if the microwave is not bolted to the counter (mine is not) opening and closing the door always moves the microwave. The fan and the motor are very noisy. By contrast the finished beep is very low and timid, to the point that sometimes I do not hear the beep. I know that it has finished when the noise stops, particularly since the finished beep does not repeat, as most other microwaves do.
On balance, it you can ignore the running noise, this is a good microwave for the price range. If I can not learn to ignore the negatives of this microwave within the next two weeks, it is going back.

The weights are reasonably accurate. I guess that's the important issue. Luckily, I don't need laboratory accuracy here.  I'm just using these weights to calibrate a cheap scale for weighing hops.

The bad news:
1. The plastic case is flimsy (the hinge was broken, so now the top just sort of lays on top).  Even if the lid was still attached, it would be rather useless, as the foam liner is too thin to hold the weights in place.  I could hear those weights rattling around loose inside when I received the package.
2. The weights have poor plating that is starting to peel off, which means those weights won't be accurate for very long.
3. And the plastic tweezers are almost comical in their uselessness.  Using those to attempt to grasp a weight is like trying to hold onto marbles while wearing mittens.

I give the whole mess 2 stars out of sheer generosity, due to the aforementioned accuracy of the weights.",2.0,negative

"Ive read all about lg, irobot, etc... but upon recommendation went with this one, for it's $150 discounted price.
Well,
Upon opening I noticed that the device does not come with a remote control.
an extra brush, a black plastic band and the charger station is all that's included next to the ample quickstart guide.
no technical specs, no usermanual.
the charger station is a flimsy plastic box, with a standard mickey mouse ear cable plug  adapter.
It took me a while to find how the base works, but the unit always said nattery error 0002.
So I had to go I nline to figure out you had to turn on the switch inside the dust bin.
After charging for 10 minutes, with battery green, I set the unit to clean the house.
It's definitely not seeking the most optimized route for cleaning, and makes surprisingly quite some noise, almost like a regular vacuum.
the problems started later, when it needed my constant attention.
It would get stuck under chairs, stop cleaning, and beep for rescue.
It doesn't see dark brown furniture, and constantly bump into it.

And on my black and white patterned carpet it constantly gets lost, beep, and thinks it's surrounded by objects (there's nothing but a clean, patterned carpet).

It's like a baby needing constant attention.
On top of that, half of my house is tiled. On the tiled part, it doesn't pick ip all dirt.
Little pieces of paper, the size of confetti, often don't get picked up.
But smaller pieces like dust, and nuts and crumbs do get picked up.

No matter what adjustments I make to this bottle filler, I can't seem to stop it from foaming up at the top of the filler.  It was also prone to spraying liquid out of the top of the filler, which was not fun to clean up.
The included hose, intended to minimize the foaming, didn't do anything.  The foam filled up the hose and the seal around the connector was so poor the foam and spray still came out from the top of the unit.

It does automatically fill bottles, though.  When it got full enough, the flow slowed and eventually stopped.  So, it works. Just not well.",2.0,negative

Hey Old Spice, if it wasn't broke, why did you mess with the scent?  Old Spice used to offer a body wash that smelled like their eons old original Old Spice after shave but if it is still produced it apparently is not available in our area.  Still, he likes the Old Spice better than some of those gosh awful smells of others such as e.g., Axe or those that emit a musk odor.  Ugh.  It is reasonably priced and comes in a fairly good sized bottle.  However, my absolute favorite scent for my hubbie is the very pricey Azzaro original.  But that's another story.",4.0,positive

You want to do the job right use wood glue for wood and epoxy for anything else that really needs a good bond.
Seriously I used this stuff for numerous glue jobs and it expands, foams up and really does not stick very well.

"My husband and I have bought these Taco Shells 5 or 6 times by now, maybe more... and there are a couple reasons why we keep coming back to these:

1. They crisp up perfectly without a bunch of oil on the surface.
2. They stand up on their own! (While not as conducive to eating them, it really helps when it comes to filling)
3. They're so cheap!
4. Every single time we have ordered them, not a single shell is cracked, broken, or otherwise damaged. This is opposite our experience with grocery store Taco Shells, where they are likely already damaged, regardless of how delicately they are hand-carried home.

"I bought this after reading all the amazing reviews. I was really disappointed because this seemed like a great combination and balance between features and price. I didn't want to settle for the more basic 20 dollar tools or go for Fluke 200 dollar meters just to be able to test for small parasitic losses in automotive applications.

Well no matter what I would try, no matter what device or load or anything it never reads A/C current. When I switch it to DC which is the main reason I bought it for, it wonders quite a lot. If I do get it to stay close to zero it might sometimes go up to .020 amps when testing a load which I know is more, and then remain there when I remove the wire being tested. About the only thing I've gotten it to actually work on is testing the entire amperage draw of the vehicle when doing 10-30 amps. Other than that it's nearly useless. I don't know if I got a defective unit but I've tried this on everything and every setting before giving up having to buy a more expensive GTC unit. Also I suspect that UNI-T does shady marketing because I keep seeing spam for this model in every other online discussion about clamp on meters that I run across, which makes me wonder how many reviews on here are legit.",1.0,negative

It glides easily and smoothly.  The only complaint I have is that it's so darned slippery that it's hard to get it to wrap around my fingers and stay put.

"I know that there are chili enthusiasts who would scoff at any canned chili and that many of them believe a ""true"" chili contains no beans. I guess I'm not one of those guys because I'm just fine with having beans in chili and the convenience of canned chili complements my lifestyle. Maybe someday I'll learn to appreciate the nuances, but for now tasty, hearty, convenient, fast and easy meets my criteria and this chili makes the grade.

I usually cube a little cheddar and add some Oyster crackers for a filling meal. I've also tried this chili poured over white rice and for me that makes a fine meal as well. I'm sure it would also be good as the chili for a chili dog meal if that's what you're looking for. I'm a fan.

"I purchased two of these meters. Each arrived with its own 50amp shunt. I connected the first meter according to the wiring diagram using a 24volt DC power supply and a calibrated 50amp electronic load. I tested the first meter and shunt and found that the meter displayed the voltage correctly but  an ampere reading that was  a little more than 3 times the load. I selected various loads between 1 amp and 25 amp, the meter ramped up and down as I changed the load but always displayed approximately three times the actual current. I used a separate calibrated ammeter and it showed the correct amperage while the DROK meter showed three times the value. I replaced the first meter and shunt with the second meter and shunt and had exactly the same response. I tried two different power supplies, one rated 12v DC and the other 24V DC. Both of the DROK meters displayed the correct voltage but both consistently showed three times the actual current flow.

I also checked and found that each meter was correctly labeled for 50 amperes, and both shunts were marked as 50 ampere, 75mv shunts.

I used a calibrated millivolt meter to confirm the actual voltage drop across both shunts (I only connected one shunt at a time to the load) and determined that the shunts were providing the correct voltage drop for the current flow.

I can only assume that there is a problem inside each meter, possibly they are incorrectly labeled.

So, unless someone out there has another suggestion, I am in the process of returning the units. Too bad, I really like the displays.",2.0,negative

"I used to buy some Japanese non-sweetened green tea at a local grocery store and grew to like it quite well. Then they stopped carrying it. It figures, doesn't it? Recently I discovered some 12-ounce cans of Ito En Green Tea at my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market, and it amounts to the same thing. I really like this stuff! No sugar, no lemon, just green tea with a little vitamin C. Tastes good. Goes down easily. Much better than that sweet stuff. My canned tea is the same as this one offered in bottles.

"The Betty Crocker Chocolate frosting is the only readymade cake frosting I find acceptable for use.  I am old enough that frosting mixes were introduced while a child, and readymade frosting was not available until I was well into my adolesence.  Thus, I learned how to whip up a cake frosting with little trouble or effort.  However, now days, even that little bit of effort is more than I have in me.  For those occassions, I rely on a can of this.  It is also good to use to make what we called quickie sandwich cookies back in my college days:  a graham cracker split in half filled with a generous dollop of this frosting.  (Very good for sustaining the scholar while studying for finals.)",4.0,positive
"I was hoping for more but these leads are reminiscent of those sold by bargain electronics houses in the 60s and 70s.  The wire is of a very light gauge which has more meaning than just current carrying capacity.  They do not stand up to flexing and will break after a short period of use.  I became curious about how the lead wires were bonded to the clips.  I pulled off a few covers and couldn't see how this was done.  finally I saw the end of a copper wire sticking out of the crimp next to where the insulation went in.  I subjected one to destructive analysis and found that after the end of the wire had been stripped the copper wire had been bent back along the insulation and the clip was crimped on it.  Without being soldered the electrical connection won't be good for long.  Wear from bending will gradually soften the insulation and the force that holds the wire and clip in contact will weaken resulting in an a high resistance connection.  Also the crimping was not uniform from one clip to another, some of them being just barely holding.  This indicates a primitive manufacturing jig or maybe they were crimped by hand using pliers.",2.0,negative

"These Band-Aids were much better than a ""sheer"" version I bought a little while ago. These have proved to be very useful to both myself and the family.

Hubby has had a lot of good use out of them when he gets cuts and scrapes working in the garage or yard......he had a scrape across a knuckle and these Band-Aids did a good job of flexing when he used them to cover this wound over a moving joint - a typically tough place to get a Band-Aid to stick and flex.

I used one just yesterday when I stuck myself with a needle while sewing. The Band-Aid stuck well and did have some flex to it so I didn't feel constricted.

The pack comes with Band-Aids in 3 different sizes, so that is good - you can pick the best size to fit the wound. Great for kids bumps and scrapes as well.

These Band-Aids do stick well, and there is some tugging to get them started when you come to taking them off. But the pad part is good and doesn't get stuck to the wound.
The only downside I have found is that they don't hold up well when wet, and it is best to just change them if they get soggy. (probably better for the wound too).

A good size selection, they stick, and they flex as described. I like them and would buy again!",4.0,positive

I usually don't have issues with the Hatchbox ABS filaments although I did have issues with their silver which has identical issues with this glow in the dark filament. This filament seems particularly brittle and I've actually broken pieces of it several times just loading it into the extruder head. This appears to be compounding the problem of it clogging the extruder nozzle while printing. It would print OK for a while and then the nozzle clogs and thus cannot extrude anymore and has to be cleaned. Unfortunately I learned about this after the return period passed and thus cannot return the unused filament which also cost extra being that it's a special filament being glow in the dark.,1.0,negative

"As a mechanical engineer, ""the little things"" matter to me.  The cheesy base this comes with slides all over the counte due to the chintzy rubber ""anti-skid"" pads that Sonicare chose to specify in order to save 2 cents per brush.  I had some small, clear, 3M rubber pads on hand and solved the problem, after cleaning the base with rubbing alcohol.

Why should I have to do this with a toothbrush in this price level?  My original Sonicare's base remained in place for a decade.  It also used a ""plastic ring design that made reinserting the brush into the charging pad a cinch. Not so with this one, which uses a relatively tiny charging ""male"" that inserts into the female base of the brush.

This brush offers five different brushing routines, but isn't ""smart"" enough to remember the last chosen setting.  Hence, it must be reset each time you brush unless the default setting is your preferred setting.  Additionally, the mode select switch (silver color) is poorly positioned and is prone to being inadvertently switched to another brushing mode during use.

A well designed brush would include a ""lock"" for the mode select switch, which would ""remember"" and lock the last setting and require 5 - 10 seconds of continuous pressing prior to being unlocked.

This brush is not a well thought out and thoroughly engineered product and I'm thinking about returning it.  People should be fired for this.",2.0,negative

This 3D printer only recived 1star because only after recieving the printer will the consumer know that you are stuck with buying filament from XYZ at $28 for a 1lb roll of PLA. Way over priced. They have chipped the filament cartridge to only work with new chips. Also you can only use there slicing software. Therr is ways around both as i have done with mine. It now accepts any filament i want to use and any slicing program i want to use. XYZWARE uses your internet to keep tabs on the printer. If i was you i would block the printers access to the internet unless you reflash the motherboard firmware. The hardware is really not bad the extruder can run PLA but needs some moding to do so. Or again you can switch to a better extruder E3dv6 is a great hotend. This printer could have been the number one printer of 2014 but of course they had to be greedy and lock the system to only use there filament and software.,1.0,negative

"I have a Delta saw with a 4 inch sawdust outlet and I have not been able to find anything that will allow me to size it down to a Craftsman vacuum hose size.  I thought this was made smaller on each end to accommodate a 4 inch hose connection; thus, I could attach another device to this one to size down the saw outlet.

Wrong.  This is exactly 4 inches in diameter.  Another fitting that is also 4 inches will not fit it.

Guess I am stuck.  I don't see how this would make anything into a quick disconnect unless what it is attaching to is more than 4 inches in diameter.

"Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking. It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move. The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap (which of course glued itself to the nozzle).
I've gone back to conventional woodworking glues and the new ones (tite-bond) are very strong so there is no real advantage to Gorilla glue.",1.0,negative

So, there's no real nutrition to speak of, somewhat high in calories and fat for a small amount. There are healthier chips available.

"Well, in some respects this is a terrific vacuum.  It's powerful, it does the job, it's easy to maneuver.  Unfortunately, however, it is plagued with problems related to the lack of strength of some of its plastic parts.  First, the cord holder clip broke, so we have to hold the cord in one hand while pushing the machine around.  Then the clip that holds the front-mounted HEPA filter door closed broke, so the door flops open frequently, which results in dust (and cat hair) being blown away from you as you try to vacuum it up.  Then the clip that holds the dust canister to the body of the vacuum broke, so it doesn't stay in place, nor can you pick up the vacuum by its handle to move it.

To Shark's credit, when I contacted them about replacement parts, they asked how long we'd had it.  Two years.  Well, they said, it has a five-year warranty, so they're sending us replacement parts free.  That's good.  But why the cheap Chinese plastic fittings to begin with???

"I usually like most Kashi products, so I thought I would give these oatmeal chocolate chip cookies a whirl.  They are a good sized soft cookie and you can break them off in smaller bits and not have them crumble.  Just sweet enough, but not so sugar sweet as many store-bought cookies.  You can also definitely feel the chew of the oatmeal and the chocolate doesn't have that cheap taste.  I honestly enjoyed them, enough that I had trouble just stopping with one.

Yes, these cookies are soft, but if you want them to stay that way you have to seal them back up again if possible once you open the package.  An old fashioned cookie tin would be just the thing, or even a sealable bag.

I wouldn't say these are the absolute best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie I've ever had--that remains in the realm of home-made cookies, specifically a ""secret"" recipe taught to me by a relative--but if you aren't into spending an afternoon baking cookies and need to grab a box of more than decent cookies to take with, then this might be the one for you.

It did nothing for grandma and when she was released to being Home Health her bed sores were pretty bad.

While I decided to share information in this review regarding a off label use to try and help those in a similar situation.  This isn't why I  chose to only give it 2 *  As that doesn't seem right to me. Rather the low rating is based on our families experience with Desitin  as a  diaper rash treatment.

"I was so hopeful that this would be the vacuums of all vacuums, but after using it less than a handful of times I'm very disappointed.

Pros:
 - It's small and lightweight
 - uhm, it's small and lightweight...
- Okay, it is fairly quiet as any ""duster"" vacuum would be...

Cons:
 - When attempting to empty the canister the debris and ""yuck"" just stays stuck in it.  I shook the canister many times to get it out but the debris barely moves.  There is really no way to get a firm hold on the canister to shake it.  I ended up needing to hold the canister upside down between my knees (so the opening is facing up) and dig it out with my hands.  I'm a transplant patient who has a low immune system and I really need to be careful of germs and dust.  This was NOT fun to do!  I used to own a Shark canister and both ends opened up on the canister so that you could push the debris through if it got stuck.  Most of the debris I vacuum up is cat hair... and this is after all made for pets, but only if you have pets that barely shed... Maybe I should try to find a good lightweight bagged vacuum because not many upright bagless work well with pet hair?
- The power is not as strong as I thought it would be.  It's great on hard surfaces, but poor suction on carpet.  It barely lifts the pile.  I need to go over items several times before it will pick up.  I want a vacuum to be strong enough to pick up small tufts of cat hair without the need to break my arm doing it...
- You would think a vacuum of this price and reputation would have a way to attach the cord higher up so that it does not get caught up under the wheels... just sayin'
- Using the hose is a nightmare!  Most vacuums with hoses are pretty easy to unhook the hose, vacuum up what you need with the hose then attach it again to continue with your job...  This hose is inside or part of the handle, and the difficult part is getting the hose back IN the handle after using it.  Then while the hose is out the vacuum is so lightweight it is not steady.  It literally feels like when you unhook the hose that the vacuum is falling apart.
- It does not do good on edges.  The power just doesn't seem strong enough to pick up even a small piece of paper unless it's directly under it.
- The canister is very small and needs dumped out after vacuuming 2-3 rooms.
-  It is expensive for what you get.  Definitely not a powerhouse vacuum for daily use unless you have VERY little to clean up.  I'm a clean person and I don't let things get too bad, but living in a state with a lot of dust and ""nature"" blowing in, it is a constant battle...

I really really really wanted to like this vacuum!!!! I've heard only good things about this brand.  I have debated whether to send it back or not.  It is not easy for me to box it up and get it shipped back due to my failing health.  I may just have to keep my older Hoover Windtunnel bagged for heavy jobs (which is highly rated from ASPCA for pets) and this one for light days and dusting the ceiling fans.  But, it is kinda high priced for that.  And, I shouldn't have to keep 2 vacuums.  If the Hoover was lighter I wouldn't have even considered the Dyson actually....

"The Etekcity Lasergrip 630 Dual Laser thermometer gun is a nice looking thermometer. It has a nice weight to it and is a nice size. It did not feel like a toy. The Etekcity 630 battery compartment has the front of the handle that swing down and you snap on the included 9 volt battery after you remove the plastic wrap off the battery and swing it back up to close it. It has all the features that I wanted, high alarm, low alarm, max temp, min temp, avg. temp, differential, adjustable EMS, data hold temp, laser on/off, backlight on/off, dual lasers and a pouch. It beeps after you let go of the trigger. And it comes with a holster. But the main thing I wanted it didn't have and that was an accurate temperature readings. It was 5-10 degrees off. I tested it against another IR gun, home thermostat and an instant read thermometer. All three of the instruments were 1/2 degrees different from each other but the Etekcity 630 was at least 5 degrees lower from all three. It also took 10 - 15 seconds to stabilize. At times, it had a max reading number which never showed on the current reading. Sometimes it was accurate and other times it was at least 5 degrees to low. What good is a thermometer if it can't give accurate readings? If it was maybe 1-2 degrees off I can maybe tolerate it but 5 degrees, no that won't do. I might have received a defective one.
I tried the Etekcity 1022 and that was very accurate but it does not have all the features that I want. It has max temp, an adjustable EMS, data hold, backlight on/off laser on/off and only one laser. It does NOT come with a holster. It was very accurate, consistent temp readings and the response was quick but the laser beam was off to the right. I returned the 1022 model for the 630 model. What a mistake. Even with an off centered beam, it was more accurate than the 630 with two good beams. I'll be returning the 630 and reordering the 1022. I rate it 2 stars.",2.0,negative

"Progresso makes a wonderful Clam Chowder. What I really like is that I can practically serve just myself from this can, after microwaving it in a microwave-save serving dish, of course. Sometimes, I get two meals out of one can.

I highly recommend this traditional New England Clam Chowder.

"As a mechanical engineer, ""the little things"" matter to me.  The cheesy base this comes with slides all over the counte due to the chintzy rubber ""anti-skid"" pads that Sonicare chose to specify in order to save 2 cents per brush.  I had some small, clear, 3M rubber pads on hand and solved the problem, after cleaning the base with rubbing alcohol.

Why should I have to do this with a toothbrush in this price level?  My original Sonicare's base remained in place for a decade.  It also used a ""plastic ring design that made reinserting the brush into the charging pad a cinch. Not so with this one, which uses a relatively tiny charging ""male"" that inserts into the female base of the brush.

This brush offers five different brushing routines, but isn't ""smart"" enough to remember the last chosen setting.  Hence, it must be reset each time you brush unless the default setting is your preferred setting.  Additionally, the mode select switch (silver color) is poorly positioned and is prone to being inadvertently switched to another brushing mode during use.

A well designed brush would include a ""lock"" for the mode select switch, which would ""remember"" and lock the last setting and require 5 - 10 seconds of continuous pressing prior to being unlocked.

This brush is not a well thought out and thoroughly engineered product and I'm thinking about returning it.  People should be fired for this.",2.0,negative

"I thought it was funny when the box of Band-Aids I'd ordered was at the very bottom of my Prime Pantry box, under a bunch of heavy stuff. The flimsy cardboard packaging used for Band-Aids these days was squashed absolutely flat.

I stopped laughing when I used the first Band-Aid. I don't know what the people who wrote all the glowing reviews were using, but the ones I got functioned nothing like the ones they describe.

According to the manufacturer, these Band-Aids have a ""unique adhesive"" and ""stay in place."" I don't think so.

They stop sticking to the skin when wet, but they stick so well to themselves that when you try to remove them, they stretch and tear rather than come off all at once (as any sane bandage does). I've ended up with many small, stretched and torn-away fragments trying to get one of these things off. Is this what's known as ""unique adhesive""?

In between removing the bandage's wrapper and getting the thing positioned correctly, if the sticky part happens to accidentally double back on itself, you can forget about getting it loose. All it will do is stretch and tear. I have to throw these in the trash.

Once, when one of the torn-off fragments landed on my carpet -- sticky side down --  it wouldn't budge. I had to cut it from the carpet using scissors.

I've always loved the Band-Aid brand, but not anymore. I'm unable to recommend this product. Even Dollar Store bandages are better (and cheaper). I'm quite disappointed in Johnson & Johnson.",1.0,negative

To be five stars for my taste, I'd lower the salt to 2-3% instead of 5% - then you could taste the nuts flavor better. The salt overpowers the different subtle nut flavors in here and they all taste about the same: salty. And I'd lower the peanut content to perhaps 30%, if possible.

"This product review is for Pringles Original Small Stacks, 1.3 Ounce (Pack of 12)

These really came pretty beat up, most of them where broken, you could basically pour the chips right in your mouth.

This was easy to make and it turned out great. My family really enjoyed this product and we will be using it again in the future.

This was the first time I had ever considered using online shopping for any of my food. Amazon Grocery had a pretty good selection of dry supply items. Everything that I ordered came nicely packed and wasn't damaged at all. These items where very easy to make and they all tasted great. When I made this purchase I had a coupon for $25 of on an order of $75 or more. It was really nice that Amazon kept track of how many items you had in your box and how much space was left. Each item also showed how much space it would take up in the box, so you had an idea of what else might fit in the box. After I had the box completely filled I simply checked out as usual and a few days later it showed up at my house

Overall these items where great and I will be ordering again in the future. What a great way to get your shopping done with out leaving the comfort of your own home.",2.0,negative

"Ive baked and cooked for more than four decades. Until my wife bought a three-pound box of Morton Coarse Kosher Salt at our local supermarket I thought that all salt was created equal. I quickly discovered that I had been wrong. This coarse salt can be used as a substitute for table salt. But it really shines as a rub for meats.

"We had a leak in the main water lines to the house (1/2 inch). The leak was at a straight connector on the pipe. The tape was put on, then covered with a rubber sleeve and then clamps used to hold all in place. The pressure of the water cased the tape to bubble up and eventually let water through. We went though the process again and this time increased the thickness of the tape. While it held for a few minutes the tape would not hold enough to prevent the loss of water. IT may have worked on a  really low pressure water line however not on a main water line to my house. We still have most of the roll which we will use in the future for very small leaks and see if the tape will hold. We had to call a plumber which we intended to do so anyway as this tape was only temporary to get us through the week end.",1.0,negative

"This was a poor purchase for me. I was looking into natural, chemical free products and stumbled upon Meyer's. I really did enjoy the scent, but that was about it. The spout once pushed down doesn't not come back up on its own. In addition, the mechanism for pushing the soap out of the spout often only squirts a little or a splattery mess. The soap itself requires two or three pumps to actually create bubbles on your hands and get a thorough washing. Because of this, it is running out fairly quickly, and I will not be purchasing again --- or any other meyer's products for that matter.",2.0,negative

"Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: ""You can work with me!""  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.",1.0,negative

Amazon appears to be diddling with the price point.  I reviewed hansen's products before and urged them to hold the price point.  They now seem to be raising it from $19 to $24/case.  At $1/can in the quantity I buy, I think I will be able to do better elsewhere.

The squirt thing is ok, but as soon as you get to the last couple inches, the squirter starts sputtering because it's coming out of the soap at the bottom of the container -  kind of inconvenient.

It was the trigger that make the switch go on and off.  That pice of plastic had broke.  IF they had made the switch with a metal piece instead of plastic the thing might have lasted a lifetime.  This will forever be a mystery to me.  Why would a designer make a critical part that will take stress both small and plastic?  Why not increase the diameter of the part (in this case very easy to do) and make it out of something that will last?  The plastic part was about 1/16 of an inch square, maybe less.  Why?  A 1/4 inch piece of good plastic would probably last 10 years.  A 1/4 inch piece of quality metal would last forever.  What would that cost?  Maybe another dollar or two max?  Incredible.

"I have a two year old Replicator 2 which has served me well; not without issues with the feeder and some Makerware hiccups- but overall it has been very solid.  With almost 1000 hrs of print time, it seemed like a good time to look for its replacement, since I assumed technology has advanced.  While reading the reviews of the Makerbot 5th gen, a very disturbing trend emerged.  One third of the five star reviews occurred on just a single day (10/14/2014)- while not one day of one-star reviews- of which there are twice as many- had two reviews.  Similarly, the positive reviews were brief, and often by Amazon users with no or very few other reviews, opposite of the one star reviews. I created a chart (hopefully it makes it through) to show the distribution of 1 and 5 star reviews by date- it speaks for itself.  Draw your own conclusions- but I'm staying clear of this product.

UPDATE: I initially only looked at five-star reviews for ""tampering""- but the four-stars are off as well.  3 of the 8 four-star reviews were done on Oct 22nd (the same day as two five-stars), and 1 of the 8 four-stars was on the same day as the ridiculous ""big day"" (Oct 14th, 2014) for five-star reviews.  That almost definitely makes many (most?) positive reviews false.  If the suspicious four and five star reviews are discounted, the 5th Gen gets a total score of around 1.6 stars (vice 2.36, as of Feb 15, 20015).  Most seasoned Amazon shoppers would not buy an very expensive product with lots of detailed reviews averaging less than two stars- thus the tampering.",1.0,negative

"This box mix comes with 3 sets of instructions: a 3-hour recipe, a 1-hour recipe, and a bread machine recipe. I bought this Country White and also Classic Sourdough mix, and tried both of the manual recipes. The bread in both cases was disappointing once baked. Other reviews said that these mixes are great in bread machines, so I am going to assume that's really the only way to be successful.

Our loaves came out large, round, and only about 1.5 inches high. The crust was fairly crunchy, all good. The inner texture was very spongey, and almost had an undercooked taste even though we baked to the full time recommendation. Having made a lot of bread from scratch, I was initially suspicious about ""no-knead"" loaves---guess it was too good to be true!",2.0,negative

"The bar was tender and moist.  It was a nice size for a snack.  That being said, why the 2 star was:

Taste.  It was cloying to me.  Not of sweet but the over all taste of what they termed cheesecake and salted caramel.  It just wasn't good. I had the desire to rinse my mouth and brush my teeth to get rid of the taste.  I've eaten good cheesecake and bad cheesecake and this wasn't cheesecake it was like some illegitimate version of a cheesecake crossed with a cheese danish crossed with a piece of hardtack.  I felt like I had a film on my teeth and mouth when I was done eating it.

Texture.  It was well... grainy and chalky.  I'm not sure how it managed both but that was the texture.

It's the first time a treat has taken me 45 minutes to eat.  And I need my head examined for doing that.  That was my stupidity.  But now I'm looking at 9 of them and wondering how in the devil I am going to pawn them off on some unsuspecting soul and if I should.

I could have had an apple with 4.4 grams fiber and about 95 calories [med size] vs this for 150 calories and 5 grams of fiber.  And I hate apples.  That's telling you something if my first  thought after finishing it was ""I could have had an apple.  It would have tasted so much better.""

That being said, you may love it and find the taste suits you.  Our tastebuds are different.  That's why we like different foods.  I'm just telling you what I found and suggesting you taste one before you buy a 10 package box.

 I foresee unless someone really likes them, this is going to have a LONG shelf life at my house.  Edited to add:  Hallelujah! My sister will take them [and the Brownies if it turns out I don't like them too.]  She loves them.  That is what I mean by different tastes.",2.0,negative
"I will be the first to admit I did not read up on the ingredients and have been using this for a bit. I have been having stomach issues that I have never had before so it might be caused by this. Once I stopped taking this, my stomach issues eased up. Something to keep in mind if you are sensitive to things.

Diabetes runs in the family and my sister wears a insulin pump. I am always worried about my blood sugar since it can get low. I was not looking for this to fix it but to help my health in general. I had a really hard time with the flavor. It sounded great but getting it down I had trouble with but got past it. I did not notice much of a change though, other than my stomach getting really upset which as I said above, eased when I stopped using the product.

I cant say if this works but can say I didn't like it.",2.0,negative

"I bought this to use with E-Z LOK's brass threaded inserts to attempt to install them by hand (I've been using the drill press method to make sure they go in straight) but this tool is complete garbage. The wings that are supposed to fit in the threaded insert's slot are severely undersized with way too much slop. They don't stay in the recess when attempting to install the inserts; it just slips out. Trying to use a bit more pressure when turning the inserts results in the slots breaking and rendering the insert useless.

The big problem is how undersized the wings on the bit are. If they were sized to match the insert slot they would probably work great.

So instead of this tool, I recommend the drill press method. Doing it that way ensures the inserts go in straight and without breaking.",1.0,negative

"I got a bad batch. The ABS was mixed with some other thermoplastic, possibly PLA but it could be anything. I only found out when I tried to dissolve some in acetone. ABS plastic dissolves completely in acetone leaving you with a mixture that you can use as glue on your heatbed, or to glue two pieces of ABS together. You can also use acetone vapor to chemically polish the surface of an ABS printed part, it's one of the great reasons for using ABS to print. This filament did not dissolve completely, there were strands of another plastic left behind that acetone does not dissolve. No matter how long I left it to dissolve, this other plastic remained, contaminating the whole bottle and making a mess. So the filament is defective and I'm returning two rolls of it. Hopefully this is just a single bad batch and not representative of the product as a whole.

"These tongs are just ok - standard student grade.  So to sum it up: They are heavy, the finger loops are small and the gripping surface is a bit thin and stiff.

The bar stock used for these tongs is heavy duty, it's a pretty solid piece of equipment and it works the way I need it to with small and light beakers, especially for the price.  The rivet holding the two scissor jaws together could be more beefy, it doesn't quite feel as solid as the bar stock it's holding together.  I would prefer a screw and lock nut or some other, more solid, replaceable and adjustable assembly hardware - like a C ring.  I'm sure the rivet will hold together fine but I prefer everything to be somewhat over-engineered for peace of mind. I'm not sure such a thing exists as I've never seen what I'm describing as being ""better"" but there is definitely room for improvement with these.  Also, I have large hands, not freakishly large but larger than average (XL glove size) - The finger loops don't really accommodate more than a couple pincher fingers each.  The weight of the bar stock is pretty heavy by itself so anything you hold in these tongs had better be very light or else you will hurt your fingers and possibly drop whatever you are holding - which defeats the purpose of using tongs to begin with.  I have yet to find a perfect pair of tongs but as I envision them they would probably be...

1. Light weight (reinforced cast aluminum?),
2. Solid assembly (rivet with c ring or screw and adjustable lock nut),
3. Thick rubber padding/tubing on jaws for better grip (thicker and more flexible grip material)
3. Large enough finger loops to accommodate four large fingers on the lower half and one large thumb on the upper half.

These tongs are supposed to replace your hand for holding a hot beaker or flask so that you don't burn yourself, they don't do that extremely well in that they are heavy and unwieldy.  The way they are made they pretty much just replace a couple pinching fingers and yet they are too heavy for the few fingers that fit into the finger loops... poor design.",2.0,negative

"This is a good tasting cereal, probably on the sweet side (the second ingredient is sugar).

As for delivery, my cereal arrived fine. There were no problems with shipping, delivery, or packaging. I received it on May 8, 2012 and the ""Best Before"" date was March 21, 2013.

I give that one 5 stars because it also tastes great (even though it's not as sweet) but the ingredients are healthier than Life.",4.0,positive

"FAKE!!! The calipers I received were counterfeit, although the best counterfeit that I've seen. The first thing I noticed was the inspection report had a printed signature instead of a hand written one. Secondly, it has a battery stapled to the instructions where the packaging says ""SR44"" but the battery itself says ""LR44."" The calipers also had a battery already installed. Mitutoyo does not do that. One of the tabs on the battery cover is broken.which is a sure sign. The rest of the packaging seems to be dead on which is scary. The calipers are functional and overall pretty good. I suspect most would never notice that these were fake unless they knew what to look for.",1.0,negative

Even though drained off liquid it is  a bit too salty for my taste.  However, I am sensitive to salt. The potassium in this product is negated by the salt.  Salt is a great preservative but too much can cause problems.

"I decided to try this cereal for a little variety, familiar with Kashi and a consumer of their Kashi Go Lean protein powder.

Ive experienced this from one other of their dry cereals previously, their Heart to Heart product, but this is worse. No, its not because theres soy in it- soy and I are friends.

The texture is rather sawdusty, but tolerable. A bit too sweet for me, but the clincher is the terrible digestive issues it causes. I don't think I will be getting this product often, if ever again.

"I received this unit about 6 months ago as a gift and used several times since then.

I found the meter readings to be highly variable with poor repeatability. I would take several readings one after another and would get differences of up to 0.4. Sometimes readings would be wildly off. I found that I needed to recalibrate in between every reading, even with a time lapse of just a few minutes.

Recalibration is an awkward task. The display is on the front of the meter, the switch is on the top and the tiny calibration screw is on the rear. Since the switch is spring loaded, i.e. you have to slide and hold to get a reading, the calibration becomes a 3 handed effort.

I never had any confidence in the readings I got from this meter and it quit working after 6 months.

I cannot recommend this meter and will be looking for something different for my needs (measuring mash pH).",1.0,negative

"I've been using the supply for bench electronics work for about a year now and I have to say I'm generally unhappy with it.

The pro's are obvious, it has a nice form factor and good specs. But here are the cons: I'd say the most annoying one is that it doesn't have any output shutoff, as in, when you turn off the power switch, it slowly browns out as the internal caps discharge. If your only powering a little IC, it can take 30 seconds or more to shutoff. I consider this unacceptable. It also means that you need to manually disconnect your project before you turn the supply on, since you can't adjust the output before you turn it on. Basically it's a pain. I've been meaning to add a manual disconnect, but I haven't gotten around to it.

A second, minor con which I'll just get out of the way here is that the readouts are pretty inaccurate. The current readout is completely useless below 100ma. I'd call this a minor problem though, since that's what you'd expect for a budget power supply.

Ok, here's the third con, which I consider the final nail in the coffin: The display on this supply has gone blank on me several times. Each time, it required a restart to get the display back. It's not random, I think it was caused by some kind of transient condition that was happening occasionally on a certain project. ..Annoying, and it calls into question the reliability of this things control circuit. I'm mildly worried that this thing is going to shoot up to 30 volts and blow up a circuit one of these days.

The only reason I gave this supply 2 starts instead of 1 is that it does serve its purpose on my bench. I just wish I had spent a little more on something better.",2.0,negative

"The Rubbermaid Service Cart appears to be very strong. It has very large wheels which roll easily over rough surfaces. The front wheels will turn while in use the back wheels are stable. The front wheels lock to stabilize the unit. It took just a few minutes to assemble the cart. It required attaching the wheels, the handle and the electric bar.
It is very easy to maneuver and has a great table top surface for parts, etc.
The only thing that I was disappointed about was the function of the drawers and door. They do not open and close as well as they should for the price. They have to be closed firmly and catch sometimes when opening.
The drawers and door can be locked though I don't think they would keep anyone except a small child from getting into the unit. All drawers lock at together and they must be maneuvered into place in order to do this. It was the push one in and the another one pops out scenario. The drawer slides seem very strong. The unit comes with four keys, two for the drawers and two for the door. They all work for both.
Overall the unit seems very tough and will likely not break. It rolls well and the design is good.
6-7 2016 - After using this cart for a time I have decided to redo my review. I found it hard to maneuver even on a cement garage floor let alone an uneven surface. It was loaded with tools, etc. The top surface of the unit has began to break away from the rest of the cart. There was nothing done to cause this to occur. The locks do not function. The drawer locks would no longer line up to allow locking of the drawers. Since they all lock together, they must line up. The locks broke and the drawers do not slide as they should. They slide and line up very poorly. It now can not be locked at all. The price is already way too high, but with the quality of this unit so low it is not worth purchasing at any price.",1.0,negative

So this is a great printer when I was working. Great prints for the money nice look and easy to use. After about 5 days the glass on printing bed just cracked buy xyz said they send me a new one. Ok... but 2 days later now the heating elelement for the extruder now will not work. They said they send that too. So we will see how that works out. Just not happy it's brand new and all ready having problems. Customer service said i need to pay for shipping ship in the bad parts then wait for them to get them and then they will ship them out. This is only a week old!! Amazon is just going to replace the whole printer. If i didn't spend like $150 in filament and use it i would return it all and get my money back!!

This is my family's favorite all time cracker.  Whether eaten plain as is or with toppers or dips this is the one they want for every day and parties.  The whole wheat is a good choice for those watching nutrition and the fiber is so helpful to the colon.  The salty taste is just right without too much salt even for children.  This crunch is a gentle one...not loud to be heard across the room but just right to give you a burst of flavor for a party in your mouth.  I keep this on hand for family snacks and for when friends drop in for drinks because it is so dependable for dips and tops.  My Wheat Thins came from Amazon in multi package.,5.0,positive

"We used this ketchup in the restaurant I worked in. However, if you check out the ingredients, there is HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP in this ketchup. HFCS is NOT healthy for you. Heinz makes an organic ketchup WITHOUT high fructose corn syrup. Am switching to that ketchup. Amazon carries the organic non-HFCS Heinz ketchup if you are interested.

If you google HFCS, you will read about the health issues behind eating HFCS. Am surprised Heinz uses it in their popular ketchups.

Ingredients: Tomato Concentrate From Red Ripe Tomatoes, Distilled Vinegar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Corn Syrup, Salt, Spice, Onion Powder, Natural Flavoring

Check out Heinz Organic Ketchup if you want to avoid the High Fructose Corn Syrup. It has only 4g of sugar per serving which is low. It is recommended that you don't go over 50g of added sugar a day by the World Health Organization, so 4g is acceptable.",2.0,negative

"If you rate this popcorn based on taste alone, it deserves a five star rating.  The flavor is absolutely delicious, and one might find themselves devouring the entire bag at one sitting.

Now for the bad - The parent company is Frito Lay. This is a corporation who is guilty of poisoning its customers daily through using GMO (Genetically Engineered) corn in their products. When I first decided to purchase this popcorn, I bought it because on the bag it specifically states No Artificial Colors, Flavors, or Preservatives.

What I didn't notice until later, was a line on the bag that says - Partially Produced with Genetic Engineering

So basically, my take on this product is that instead of calling this Frito Lay Popcorn, they disguise it by calling it ""Smartfood delight"" - making us think that this is a healthier alternative by claiming that it has No artificial colors, Flavors, or preservatives...but if the popcorn itself is GMO (Genetically engineered) Corn, does anything else really matter?  There is nothing healthy about GMO foods. Furthermore the companies who try to feed them to us through deceptive marketing and advertising should be punished or at the very least called out publicly and shamed for their unethical behavior.

The reason I decided to give this product a 1 star rating is because I want people to read my review, and I don't feel as if a 2 or 3 star review would get looked at, as much as a 1 star review.

I also want to reiterate that the product does taste delicious,  so if you are the type of person who doesn't care about whether or not you were eating genetically engineered foods, then this product is a popcorn that you would buy based on taste alone. As for the rest of us, I feel like I just got bamboozled because I didn't read the bag close enough when making the original purchase.

I have included two pics from a bag of their White Chedder flavor to help illustrate my points.",1.0,negative

Yes, the filling tastes like toothpaste, a problem I have had with no other mint-flavored foods.

I ate some and was horrified, and assumed I just had a bad taste in my mouth or ate them with the wrong thing.  A couple days later I ate some more, and the same problem.  Tried a third time on another day just in case, and just gave up and threw away two-thirds of the package.

The second cookie, I was, ""Oh, this isn't so bad."" By the third cookie a few days later, it seems my tongue acclimated to this texture and could appreciate this for what it is: a healthier cookie.

I must say, I enjoy them now. I think I had to get the idea of Oreos/ChipsAhoy/Tate's/Etc type cookies out of my brain and expect a healthier cookie, not a junk cookie. Expectations matter. Imagine if you are going to take a sip of cocoa, but it turns out there's tea in the cup. Your mouth doesn't like what it just tasted, because of expectations.

These are actually pretty good. Just get ""cookie"" out of your head and think ""chewy high fiber chocolatey treat.""  It's 4 grams of fiber per cookie and very little saturated fat and a it's a good-sized cookie (130 cals per). You only need ONE with your coffee or tea or cocoa to feel satisfied.

Year ago we started buying just about any tuna that was on the shelves as long as the price was right. Then we started noticing that light tuna seemed to be dark and the taste was strong. So we switched to the Solid White Albacore and found that  most BUT not all cans we actually did receive white tuna. I don't understand why some cans in the same package have such different kinds of meat int eh can. Then what ticked us of even moire was noticing the diminishing size of the cans. Now the same cans are getting so small that if you make a tuna salad it will probably only be enough to serve tow people instead of four. Then to make matters worse the prices have increased in the past few years to where tuna is now becoming a gourmet item at the table. While the Bumble Bee Solid White is better than most it seems that the issues raised prevail in the entire industry.,4.0,positive

"I tried the Sonicare and was really surprised by how powerful it is....even in the the ""sensitive"" setting. This just seems like too much. Saving time brushing will usually mean you are brushing too hard, and likely cause gum recession and tooth abrasion. You need to brush softly, but for between 2-3 minutes, 2-3 times/day (as well as flossing, which nothing can replace). ""No pain, no gain,"" does NOT apply to toothbrushing. I certainly would not recommend this for your teeth. I think if they can tone it down 75%, it might actually be good. The gum ""massager,"" mode makes no sense. Proper tooth and gingival care has more to do with the prevention of accumulation of plaque, etc., and ""massaging,"" the gum is just a great marketing idea. I think the only people who really need to use an electric toothbrush are those with dexterity issues, etc., and they may benefit from the use of an electric toothbrush, but the trade off, e.g. recession, etc., may not be worth it. Also, you can't really try to put less pressure on it, because then it will not clean that well. I can also tell you that you will spurt toothpaste all over unless you wait to turn it on when it is in your mouth...the vibration is just that harsh. If you accidently hit your tooth with it, and you will, you will feel like there is a jackhammer in your mouth! I know there are a lot of people out there who are huge fans of these....I am not one of them. If you are still considering this item.....You only get one head, so if you want to share this (if you are a fan) you will have to spend more on another head. It does come with different colored rings so you can identify different brushes, but those rings slip around, perhaps because of the harsh vibration (I pressed pretty hard to put the two pieces together). The actual quality is very good, and it feels sturdy and not cheaply made. I just cannot recommend something that makes my teeth hurt after using it, no matter how it feels, or how cool it looks (and it does look pretty cool and hi-tech). For about two-three percent of the cost of the Sonicare (and no operating cost) you can have a superior instrument to keep your teeth and gums healthy.",2.0,negative

"About 1/3 - 1/2 of these clamps failed at the point of installation. I would turn the screw and it would tighten for a while but when I made the ""last"" turn to make it as tight as I could (where the adjusting screw doesn't turn any more), the screw would just turn freely and the pressure exerted by the clamp would disappear. I've never had a radiator clamp strip before and I'm not a super strong twister of screws.  So I was pretty surprised at the rate of failure.  I bought several different boxes and several different sizes and had the same general experience with all sizes and lots.

I don't know the nature of the failure. And I don't know whether the clamps that didn't strip are durably strong.  But I use them mainly to connect pipe and fittings in an underground irrigation systems.  So the cost of fixing a broken clamp is very high in terms of lost water, time to locate the leak, time to dig up the joint and time to redo the original job.  I sympathize with the reviewer  who lost an engine using these.  These clamps have a low price but are very expensive in the long run.",1.0,negative

2018, January Update: The price is now 27.87 which is still to high. When you get down to the inside winds of this filament it is wound so tight in a small circle that it wants to break just sitting on the spool.

"I have purchased clear bags from a number of manufacturers. Clean laundry is folded into them, and after carrying upstairs, If I'm too lazy to remove the contents and place in a dresser (which is 99% of the time), anything I need is easy to see in that clear bag.

Now mind you, I was well aware that these low-density bags are only able to hold a very light weight, but problems started as I opened the bag. What was the problem?

It wasn't a bag.

It was a large piece of plastic sheet that was connected only at the bottom. Since it could not be used as a bag, I put it on the floor  and placed a low quality puppy pad over it. My thinking was that at least I could use it as a liner to keep the floor dry as my little pups used the wee-wee pad.
Lets just say the leaky puppy pad had an equally leaky partner in crime.

Now, had it actually been a bag, it would be good for what it is...a trash liner for very light paper as the stock photo shows. It may be a 60 gallon bag, but doubt it would hold more than 5 pounds.
If UPS or the USPS deliver a large package, and it's raining, they sometimes cover it with a bag like this. Just enough to shield the package, not hefty enough to actually carry the package.

If that is what you need these for, and you don't mind the irregulars, they will work well for you.",2.0,negative

"I used to always buy Volvic water but then Amazon ran out of stock and other sellers start jacking up prices as much as $70 for 12 bottles. I was forced to switch to FIJI water since Amazon don't seem to be restocking Volvic water anytime soon.

This water is good, I wish it was smooth as Volvic water though. This water is great if you don't want to go to a less 'premium' water. The main reason I stick to these waters is because of the silica and how much better it is than deer park, poland spring, etc.

Overall I would buy this water again, I just wish it was cheaper.

"The newest trend in vacuums are the ""compact upright"" slim/lightweight profile vacuums. Most of them are under 12 pounds & around $50.

The Airspeed One is the compact version of the Eureka Airspeed product line. If you've read my other reviews, you'd know I'm a huge fan of Eureka. Their motors & suction are just as good Dyson, no joke.

The Airspeed One is only 10 amps (not 12), and it's not ""lossless suction"" (it has a cheap foam filter that can clog the whole works). But the motor & suction are still excellent, almost on par with the other Airspeed products, at about half the weight & half the price.

BUT... the Airspeed One has so many other flaws I do not recommend it.

It is cheaply made. They cut every corner possible. The handle & canister fall out easily. I'm constantly reassembling it. There is no upright lock position (the thing is falling over *all* the time). The parts are paper-thin plastic & break easily. The hose is very short & not stretch - you can't do the stairs, the ceiling fan, etc. The cord is too short. This is such a step backwards for Eureka, it just makes vacuuming a horrible chore.

Not to worry. There are 2 options I urge you to consider before making your decision.

The first is the Bissell PowerForce Compact. It has a little less suction than the Airspeed One (only 7 amps), but fewer problems. So I consider it a step up...and it's cheaper! Today, both the Airspeed One and the Bissell PowerForce Compact are $53 on Amazon, but the Bissell is only $39 at Walmart! That's 20% less for a more reliable machine.

However in my opinion the much better choice is the Eureka upgrade - the AirSpeed One ""Turbo"". It solves most of the problems I mentioned. It has a stretch hose, better on-board tools, the cord is 5 feet longer, & higher quality parts (it's built better). And while it's currently $75 on Amazon, it's only $53.99 at Walmart! In other words, get the upgraded version for the same price. A much better deal all around.

Please be aware that Amazon prices fluctuate, almost daily. Hope this helps - happy cleaning!",2.0,negative

"I'm highly disappointed with this Maxwell House instant coffee. This was my first experience with instant coffee, and because of it I know I will not be returning to instant coffee anytime soon. I am a regular coffee drinker, I prefer espresso-based drinks like cappuccinos, but often drink lattes as well. I was expecting this to resemble a vanilla latte in flavor if not consistency.

This instant coffee tastes like if you put a tiny bit of vanilla creamer into water, heated it up, and then smoked it somehow. Like it has a weird smoky flavor I can't explain. I did not get any coffee flavor at all from this instant coffee (no matter how much powder I put in), and instead got a weird smoky-vanilla water. It was gross - I'm cringing just thinking about it.

"Without giving you a doctorate in salt...I use kosher salt for only two things in my kitchen, scrubbing my cast iron pans and making prosciutto. So I always have a couple of boxes in my pantry. Kosher salt is one dimensional in flavor so despite the TV chefs love for it I never use it to cook. If you want a salt to cook with look at more three dimensional salts with terrior to them. Imagine it this way, a short person wishes they were an inch or two taller. This table salt or kosher salt only add saltiness to the dish nothing else. A more specialty salt gives your dish that extra inch (you were wondering how short people worked in this). Then a freshly cracked black pepper add another in to your dish, even a specialty pepper adds another inch, soon your dish is a foot taller (more flavorful and unique).
This salt has a place in your kitchen, just not for the worship that the TV chefs make you think.",5.0,positive

"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.

Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""

Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.

You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.",5.0,positive

The texture and appearance are of that of refried black beans. I had to scoop this out of the can with a spoon. While I do enjoy thick soups this was just so thick it didn't seem like soup anymore.

"This has become more and more difficult to find in the stores - almost everything is mint flavored anymore, and we don't use mint products.  Our dentist and his dental hygienist strongly recommend this brand and I got a good explanation why during my last cleaning, so we checked Amazon for the unflavored variety.  According to our dentist's office, this actually traps more food than waxed floss because of being made from Gore-tex.  Initially, I was quite happy at a large quantity at a good price, and an easy source.

But something in the back of my mind triggered an internet search on Glide and Gore-tex.  Immediately I found the long list of articles claiming I was going to die from all kinds of different cancers, get brain damage, etc., because of the chemicals used to make Gore-tex and Glide floss.

Frankly, I'm more than a little sick of all the horror stories on the internet about almost any subject one can find.  Everything is going to make us die horrible deaths, if the internet is to be believed.  Yet it's important to know that in our family we now use as few chemicals as reasonably possible.  We don't use chemicals in our garden, and have the best crops of veggies ever this year.  And yes, we use Black Berkey water filters for our supposedly high quality tap water, drinking or cooking nothing out of the tap unless it's first gone through our Berkey filter. (Note: don't buy Berkey filters on Amazon - Berkey doesn't warrant them because of the practices of some of the after-market companies.)  We use various other products that area as natural as we can get, and eat a lot of organic foods, drink raw milk, etc.  Sound like some healthfood whackos? Maybe - yet remember, I was initially skeptical about the massive number of warning articles about the perfluoro- compounds in Glide floss.  Why?  I want reasonable proof of things.

And I kept looking, and looking, and can find almost nothing substantiating the safety of these compounds, or even that they supposedly no longer persist in the finished product - just that they're used in creating it (that was the argument with them in creating Teflon).  And I spent considerable time searching the P&G web site, searched all of their FAQs for this product, and even attempted to find a product safety data sheet on this product - they don't list one despite having such sheets for other products - they don't even have an ""ingredients"" sheet for Glide floss.

So my bottom line is that I'm out the money spent on this product because it's past the Amazon return period.  Fine - not Amazon's fault, they're just a retailer, or the vehicle retailers use.  But out of what now seems more like reasonable caution, rather than a ""just in case"" caution, I am discontinuing the use of this product, and going back to my previous unflavored, waxed regular dental floss.

"What has the world come to? I had been buying these as go-to's for when all else failed, but I opened up a can the other day and these are definitely worse than they were when I was a kid. I've done a lot of thinking about it and tried to wade through the inevitable sense that everything was better then anyway, but I think these truly are worse nowadays.

The meatballs are nearly flavorless and the sauce is thin and missing nearly as much as its molded meat-bean buddies. I've tried adding herbs, but the flavor profile of actual foodstuffs mixed into the slop only highlight its guise to be passed of as something edible - forgot about cheese.

Don't serve this stuff to your kids. If you've already gotten them hooked, then, well, okay, but don't get them on the habit if you can help it. Keeping a box of pasta and a jar of sauce at the ready can serve up a much better meal more quickly. Heck, make a pot of pasta and keep it in the fridge. We can't keep supporting this stuff.",1.0,negative

"update:  IT BROKE.  CAN'T FIX IT. DYSON WONT TAKE IT BACK EVEN THOUGH ITS UNDER WARRENTY. I HAVENT HAD TIME TO TAKE TO DYSON AUTHORIZED RETAILER TO FIX.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. DONT FALL FOR THE HYPE LIKE I DID.

Ok so I wanted to fall heads over heels in love with this vacuum but, honestly, I just didn't.  I have a Hoover windtunnel already but had an amazon gift card and saw this on sale so thought 'Gee now might be the time to get the dyson I always wanted'.  The truth is that it has some advantages to the windtunnel, some disadvantages.  The biggest disadvantage is that it gets clogged pretty easily.  Also, it doesn't pick up larger items (like popcorn or cheerios) unless you use hose attachments, but then it gets clogged.  Also it doesn't have that little hook thing to clip the cord into while you are vacuuming (a small thing I know but still, I like that hook).  Advantages are good suction and someone the design doesn't suck up the rope edges of my carpet and get all tangled.  There are three attachments that come with the vacuum and after much heming and hawing I figured out that they DO all attach - one attaches to the end of the power cord (when not in use of course) and the other two go on the sides.  (See pics).  So... at full price, I would not recommend.  If you get a bargain, sure- go for it - this is a nice vacuum but nothing amazing like I expected.  I guess next I will get a Miew  (or whatever that German brand is) and go back to bags.",1.0,negative

"I bought this foolishly last time I was at Target (I try to only go there once every 12-18months or so) because of a buy one get one free coupon... I'm hoping a grocer nearby will give credit for the one that will remain unopened-otherwise it's a literal four bucks and 1 gel tab down the drain. Within two hours my eyes were irritated, but I stupidly gave myself a little time and few flushes to see if it was only an initial blast of harsh chemicals. Nope-the entire bathroom and EVERYTHING in it STINK now, a mere half day into its supposed week.

Imagine a massively concentrated industrial toilet cleaner-or a mix of Irish Spring soap and Lysol bowl cleaner-and ponder whether you want it absolutely permeating every millimeter of some items... Shower curtain-not the end of the world. The actual sink&bath tub-I suppose showering is fine-washing the tub TWICE to soak seems a waste. How about toilet paper? We know where that goes-starting to get uncomfortable now. Feminine hygiene? Great, just the fragrance I always wanted there-toilet bowl disinfectant... Let's not forget the towels, ALL of them. Want to dry off with something smelling like that? What about washing and drying your face with stinky cloth? Your fancy soap now needs a rinse before using, sustainable, eh? Oh, what's that? My Q-tips&makeup brushes&sponges that while not used often aren't cheap...pity that pressed powder and blush isn't in an airtight container, too.

What REALLY drew my attention to how pervasive and bad the smell had become in so little time was my CAT. I have massive 54"" tall body towels that I toss over her cat bed. They're naturally stored in the bathroom closet with all my bath-kitchen-hand towels and my cat howled-a TERRIFYING sound-and refused to lie on the towel despite initial happiness. I had to take a thankfully-bedroom-stored flannel sheet and plop down she went, happy sprawl achieved once she got over the shock of that horrid smell in her cat bed. No way am I going to leave it to permanently wreck my teak spa mat&likely even the shower head what with its grippy handle and the little rubber inserts. My bottles of shampoo&the like, my cotton pads, my medical tape&gauze, and again the absorbent items that touch my most delicate skin, from Kleenex to Kotex so to speak, reek! There's a LOT of laundry to do now, CLEAN laundry that I can't put so near my face with it stinking of hospital bathrooms--it's not so unlike that steri-clean soft-n-sure soap that hateful clinics use, the ones that want everyone to smell like they were made in a toxic chemistry lab to make nursing homes smell that special kind of bad stench!
I'll stick with the smell that leaves with the second flush. This should DEFINITELY never be used in a house with kids or pets-bad enough exposing adults to it but airborne irritants are never good news&quite unkind to expose will-free kids&pets.",1.0,negative

"According to consumer reports, rice grown in California has the lowest levels of arsenic, however brown rice has the highest levels of arsenic because of the higher concentrations in the bran or the rice.  My family eats a lot of rice and the more I read about arsenic levels in rice the more concerned I became and I was happy to find out that there is rice available from areas that are fairly reliable when it comes to lower arsenic levels, but I remain concerned about the levels in all brown rices.  Lundberg brown basmati rice has always been very tasty and aromatic but we will eat less of it, while I wait for more research to come out about the harmful effects of higher arsenic levels vs the benefits of brown over white rice. Lundberg more than any other rice grower has responded with concern and is doing their own research into lowering arsenic levels in the rice, which I appreciate as a consumer.  I'm still giving this 4 stars because it is superior over other brands.

"Before you read further, let me warn you.  XYZ uses garbage heating elements.  The heating element in the extruder will go bad no matter which one you use, it's just a wearable component but the ones XYZ uses (and the replacements they send) do not last more then 2-3 days.  Normally you should get 6 months to a year out of this part, 2 years if you are not using this thing heavily.  So, tape an allen key to the side of your printer because you're going to be changing heating elements a lot!

XYZ's facebook page is pretty great.  They responded on facebook within minutes, providing tips and links to tutorials that others have found helpful.

The printer itself looks really professional.  It's the first ""finished"" looking 3d printer that I've seen that has a usable build area.  The 7.8"" build area is massive compared to other printers triple the price of this one.  You're getting a printer that prints better models than the $1500 models and looks better as well!  It comes pre-calibrated but the novice user will still have to overcome a learning curve.  Shapes made in sketchup or similar software do not always transfer cleanly through the XYZ ware, so make sure you preview the post-slice rendering before you allow it to print.

My first few prints were disastrous but once I had a thin layer of dried glue and leftover plastic on the base, they got better.  I've had a lot more luck leaving the glass plate ""dirty"" than when it is perfectly clean and smooth.  The printer comes with a glue stick, you should apply a thin coat and let it dry before printing.  The plastic sticks to the glue instead of the glass and your models are a lot easier to remove.  You're only going to get 1 or 2 good prints though before you're sent spiraling into calibration hell...  Anyone who's printed 2-3 objects will know what I'm talking about - and if they deny this, they're lying.  The vibrations from the pieces moving on the printer will knock the heated bed out of alignment and you'll spend hours turning the tiny wheels and testing calibration to try and get it back.  I don't know of any printer that has automated this process yet - but when someone does... please let me know!!!

The software tends to butcher 3d models, even shapes that the printer seems very capable of printing.  Once you get the trick of how the software will treat your models you do alright though.  Make sure you preview what the model changes into after being ""sliced"" before you confirm the print.

The resolution is okay.  It's not great.  It took me a bit to figure out how to adjust this.  The XYZ software seems really outdated and it's not very intuitive.  Just like any other thermal 3d printer, everything you print is going to be covered in lines from the layering.  You can adjust the settings to make slightly thinner layers but you have to do this every time you print.  They claim 100 micron resolution - and I just don't see it.  The best I've gotten, even using higher quality plastic than xyz offers, is 200 microns.

With stronger software, this printer would be really awesome.

That being said, it is absolutely the best printer for the money.  It prints at the same quality as other printers for about half the cost... but I just don't honestly think the technology is there yet for proper ""home use.""  You CANNOT just plug this thing in and print.  You need to learn the quirks and adjustments and perform lots and lots of maintenance on this thing.

There simply is not a home-use-ready 3d printer out there yet.  They all take a while to get used to and they will all give you ""birds nests"" until you get the hang of them... which is disappointing because you shouldn't need an engineering degree to operate a device that functions on technology from the 1970s!",2.0,negative

"I prefer less salty roasted nut options and this one was a great mix. The nuts are just lightly salted, which makes them more enjoyable for me.

The mix is mostly peanuts and almonds, but it had a good selection of other nuts.
-> The peanuts were good tasting, just lightly roasted, but not as flavorful as other peanuts I have tasted from Planters.
-> The almonds have a dry roasted flavor.
-> The mix has some walnuts and pecans, both mostly pieces but some pieces are quite large; walnuts were crunchy and dry, lacking flavor; pecans were less dry, almost buttery, but again lacked flavor.
-> There were few pistachios in the mix, but they were absolutely delicious.
-> Hazelnuts are sometimes hardly there, but I had some cans with decent amount of hazelnuts. Those had a strange almost `raw` flavor, most probably there were not actually roasted.

Overall I enjoyed having a mix of nuts (I used them for various recipes requiring certain nuts, not only for snacking). This review is for the

"This peanut butter was served as a last meal to those being executed in the gulags in Soviet Russia. This peanut butter was also used by the Khmer Rouge to really make people feel as though there is no way out of the work camps. A food crate was busted open in Kenya during one of the last famine periods only to remain untouched as people would rather starve that ingest this foul substance. This Jif Natural Peanut Butter Spread and Honey, 16 oz should be tried in Nuremberg because its taste is a war crime.

Something about the sickly sweet taste makes it unsuitable for toasted bread. This Peanut Butter spread also makes bad bedfellows with jelly due to its foul taste blocking out all enjoyment that the jelly might have provided. I must believe that those who bought this product with the Smuckers squeeze bottle jelly are so tweaked out on methamphetamine that the taste buds are failing them. One suggestion I missed with this product was to try it on a vegetable; I couldn't bear the thought of having a farmer work so hard on growing celery only to see it ravaged by this terrible product.

"Want to put a little high fructose corn syrup on your meat?  Then buy this bbq sauce.  This is a sweet BBQ sauce. However, nutritionists and doctors recommend staying away from high fructose corn syrup and this sauce lists it as the first ingredient. Why is HFCS bad for you? Here's what a cardiologist says:

""High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a type of sugar that has been processed and combined with corn syrup to produce a cheap, easily dissolvable sweetener. But this sugar is quickly absorbed by the liver where it is converted into fat. Since your brain doesn't recognize HFCS as regular food, it never shuts off the appetite center -- so you keep eating. Blood sugar levels rise, massive amounts of insulin is recruited to metabolize it and then you crash and feel hungry again. It is found in soft drinks, fruit juices, salad dressings and baked goods. Read the food labels of products in your pantry and refrigerator and throw out all products that contain HFCS.""

 A family member bought this brand without reading the label, so we'll be throwing it out. Too much corn syrup does nasty things to your body - there are BBQ Sauces which are healthier. This one lists it as a primary ingredient:

High Fructose Corn Syrup, Distilled Vinegar, Tomato Paste, Modified Food Starch, contains less than 2% of: Salt, Pineapple Juice Concentrate, Natural Smoke Flavor, Spices, Caramel Color, Sodium Benzoate as a preservative, Molasses, Corn Syrup, Garlic,* Sugar, Tamarind, Natural Flavor.

If you only like sweet BBQ sauces, then they may be high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup. There are tangier sauces which contain no high fructose corn syrup and are lower in sugar.

I personally like Stubbs BBQ which you can get on Amazon which doesn't have high fructose corn syrup.",1.0,negative

"These were OK. Flavor and sweetness level was good. They are chocolate and have chocolate chips in some of them.

However I found them to be hard and kind of dense. Like the dough doesn't rise at all during baking. Teeny tiny chocolate flavored bricks. Hard to bite into. Doesn't easily soften in milk or your mouth. You really have to chew these. My 2 and 4 year old were excited about these at first but probably found them hard to eat because after a couple I found them spitting slimey crumbled up bunnies all over the floor. And they didn't want any more...ever. They would rather eat saltines than these.

I kept them a couple of weeks but the kids never wanted them so I threw them out. It's great they're organic but who cares when no one (not even me) wants to eat them.",2.0,negative

When nostalgia gets the best of me, give me a grape jelly and peanut butter sandwich on soft nutrient void bread.

And since the bread is so soft, you have to stir the jelly so that it can be evenly spread without causing the bread to disintegrate.
This bottle has a slit instead of a wide mouth opening, and the jelly itself is slightly thinner. Those two factors make it easy to efficiently and quickly get the purple goo out of the bottle and into your mouth.

"I had to think a long time about buying 12 cans of soup at once, but am so pleased I did. At less than $3 per can, a box was delivered right to my door. My local markets do not have this wonderful flavor. In larger Kroger's or Walmarts they have gluten-free Progresso soups, but seldom this ONE which is my favorite BY FAR. (It probably flies off the shelf.)

Campbell's soups are full of gluten and make me sick. It was so fantastic to find that Progresso made Gluten-free soups. Wow! Thank you Progresso!!!!! This Chicken Enchilada soup is the soup I crave. I love food.

So...just to let you know, you can use this when you are craving a good mild cheese sauce. For lunch today I had some restaurant left-over Spanish Rice and refried beans. I simply put that on my plate, added a gluten-free corn tortilla and then covered it with this fabulous soup/sauce. YUMMO!!!! If you are a celiac like I am, you will find this soup delicious beyond belief.

"I hate the applicator that comes with this mascara.  I'll admit, I'm a bit of a mascara snob.  My go to mascara's are Lancme Definicils and Younique 3D but, I recently tried a very cheap Elf mascara because the price was great and I was completely impressed so I thought maybe drugstore mascaras had improved.  After all, I've been using Lancme for over 10 years and makeup has come a long way.  So, I got this, also at a great price, with high hopes.  Turns out it was a complete waste of money...I'm just glad it wasn't much.

The applicator is really big, almost oversized but has short, sparse, hard little bristles that offer no chance for creating volume.  The wand picks up way more mascara than the brush and is hard to use without making a mess.  The mascara goes on clumpy and actually, unbelievably,  makes my lashes look thinner.  It doesn't harden well.  The color is awful.  It's supposed to be black/brown which, in my experience is usually pretty dark.  This is brown, not dark at all.  The one positive thing I can say about this is that it is indeed waterproof...took forever to remove.  I totally understand now why Amazon was offering a $3.00 coupon and $5.93 mascara.  Unfortunately, it's not worth the difference.  If you want a decent cheap volumizing mascara, try the e.l.f. Volume Plumping mascara.  It has its faults but at less than $3.00, it's far superior than this and it does make my lashes look thicker and fuller.",1.0,negative

"WD-40 is outdated, but every house seems to have one due to tradition/habit. Most people haven't questioned why things they lube only stay lubed a week or why things they use WD-40 on seem to end up gritty, grimey, and stuffed full of crud that's been attracted from unknown places.

The only use for WD-40 is water displacement, and other products still do a better job. Lubrication and rust prevention don't last longer than a few days to 1 week with WD-40 AND it attracts grit and grime like a magnet, making the problem worse AND compounding the problem if all you're doing is spraying on more WD-40.

In my house hold, all WD-40 cans have been replaced by Breakfree CLP or Corrosion X. With either product, and for the same price, you get a penetrating oil that will get into stuck nuts and bolts and free them up. The lubrication will last much much longer than WD-40: squeaky indoor hinges will stay quiet for 2 years+ AND stay grit free. Rust is also prevented much much better. I use CLP to coat my outdoor padlocks and they stay shiney and operate smoothly for at least a year in rain or shine.....they would rust up heavily after 1 week if only coated with WD-40, and all sorts of dirt gets sucked into the mechanism.

WD-40 has no place in the home. It should be sitting in a museum. It's an inferior lube and rust preventer. It attracts grime and grit like a magnet. Not only does it suck as an oil, it will negatively affect moving machine parts. Use other oils and greases available.",1.0,negative
"Clam chowder is one of my favorite foods and I have no qualms about calling Progresso a bad clam chowder. It doesn't taste good because it's made from cheap stuff. The taste is pasty rather than rich and savory. When I make my own clam chowder, I use flour and a considerable amount of butter and milk or cream, not soybean oil. Notice in the ingredients list below that cream and butter is less than 1% of this product, which is why this product tastes chalky and bland. It's got the right color, but the wrong taste. The texture is monotonous because it's just the diced potatoes in here that I can taste. Some celery pieces would've given the soup some textural variety. The clam pieces are very few and I don't taste them at all. I don't taste any of the other seafood powder flavorings, so I wonder why Progresso even bothered with them. There's also artificial color in here (white?) and DATEM, which is an emulsifier (keeps the oil from separating out).

Ingredients: Clam Broth, Potatoes, Clams, Soybean Oil, Water, Modified Food Starch, Onions. Contains Less than 1% of: Soy Protein Concentrate, Sugar, Salt, Cream, Butter, Sodium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Artificial Color, DATEM, Lobster Powder, Natural Flavor, Shrimp, Crab Powder, Parsley (Dried), Celery (Dried), Fish Powder, Tuna Extract, Spice, Yeast Extract, Corn Protein (Hydrolyzed), Whey.

1 can is 2 servings. Each serving is 180 calories (80 from fat) and 890 mg of sodium (37% of your daily intake). Who eats just half a can of soup?

Walgreens consistently has this on sale for about half the price, so there's no reason to order it from here unless you cannot find this locally and are desperate for bad clam chowder in a can. It's basically just a bland, can of diced potatoes in a white starchy goo, so I don't recommend it at all. There's very little nutrition in here (1g fiber, calcium 2%, iron 4%) and it's mostly just empty calories. It's edible, but I won't ever buy this again.",2.0,negative
"Update:
I use to really love this  Hello Hydration by Herbal Essence but over the past several months I noticed a change in the color and smell of the product. Both the shampoo and the conditioner. It was also leaving my hair dull and my curly hair was less curly as if I straightened it. I am not sure what changes were made to the product but  I have given up using this product completely now. I didn't notice anymore breaking or dryness from it. My hair color was changing to ""light brown"" I tried a couple other herbal essences before changing over to TRESemme brand. I wouldn't recommend this product anymore.
[ Orginal Five Star Review]
I have waist length red curly hair, that tends to be very dry. I have tried many hair products over the years. From Wen to most recently Tresemme curl hydration. What I always seem to run into is, products that are difficult to wash out. I tried Herbal Essence Hello Hydrantion. I was skeptical about seeing improvements after one shampoo. It sounded too good to be true.
Boy was I ever surprised, when it turned out to be true!

Best of all it washes out easier then any product  I have ever used. I was very, very impressed by this. Paired with the hello hydration conditioner and suave detangler while blow drying my hair has been softer then it has ever been. It also  has made it more red and less dull , while really bringing out my curls too.

"Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water, 5 Ounce (142g) Can (Pack of 24), from Bumble Bee.
It is good news for folks who happen to be on a low salt diet due to high blood pressure or water retention problems, that a 5 oz. can of Premium Tuna Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna In Water, now contains 140mg of salt, instead of the 180mg that it used to contain. My question, is why don't they go even further, similar to the 35mg of salt contained in their ""BUMBLE BEE Prime Fillet Solid White Albacore Very Low Sodium in Water"".  Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt than is good for us. Beyond all that, this Premium Solid White Albacore Tuna is great.  I never have finally decided on whether I prefer it to be packed in water or soybean oil. I dump out the liquid anyway, add Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise, pickle slices, and maybe some salt and pepper, before eating it as a snack right out of the can. I would never eat the recalled stuff, the chunk light tuna. I have always considered the chunk light tuna to be leftover scraps, better used as cat food. I never understood the reason why they cut the amount of tuna from 6 ounces to 5 ounces, as any competitive cost savings on ingredients would eventually spiral down to the level of 1 ounce cans. Anyway, I gave this 5 ounce can of tuna five Amazon stars.  Note: Comparing their Premium Tuna with their more expensive Prime Fillet Tuna, is a story for another day.

"This product review is for Old El Paso Soft Taco Bake Dinner Kit, 8.4 Ounce

I used steak instead of ground beef and it turned out amazing.

This was easy to make and it turned out great. My family really enjoyed this product and we will be using it again in the future.

This was the first time I had ever considered using online shopping for any of my food. Amazon Grocery had a pretty good selection of dry supply items. Everything that I ordered came nicely packed and wasn't damaged at all. These items where very easy to make and they all tasted great. When I made this purchase I had a coupon for $25 of on an order of $75 or more. It was really nice that Amazon kept track of how many items you had in your box and how much space was left. Each item also showed how much space it would take up in the box, so you had an idea of what else might fit in the box. After I had the box completely filled I simply checked out as usual and a few days later it showed up at my house

Overall these items where great and I will be ordering again in the future. What a great way to get your shopping done with out leaving the comfort of your own home.",5.0,positive

Not only is the bag super small but it was only filled up about 20%, so overall I got maybe 10 chips in the whole bag for a little under $2.00. Complete rip-off.",1.0,negative

"I am very meticulous about my diabetes management and care.  I take oral medications, and while my numbers aren't perfect, I do run an A1C of 6.1 (give or take .1 - .3).

I've heard the so-called benefits of Coconut Sugar, and have been focusing on low-glycemic meals for some time, so giving Coconut Palm Sugar a whirl seemed like a no-brainer to me.

I ordered a package set up a very informal test to gauge its efficacy, and now am sitting down to write my review.

So?

First: My Test Construct

To test this product, and compare it to other products, I used the following:
1. For food, I had 1 cup of plain cooked steel-cut oatmeal
2. For beverages I used 16 oz of home-brewed unsweetned ice tea

I ran each test on different days (e.g. Day 1 - Coconut Sugar in Oatmeal; Day 2 Coconut Sugar in Ice Tea; Day 3 Equal in Oatmeal, and so forth) and tried the tests at the same time of day.

Observations:

A. Flavor - I found a slight flavor profile shift and an unappetizing colorization (to the yellowish-brown spectrum). This was the first negative for me.

B. Sweetness - in the oatmeal test, I used 1 tsp of the product (the recommended serving size) in my oatmeal
  - I could discern no appreciable sweetening of the oatmeal
  - Glycemic Load - I found no real significant difference between this product, Equal, or plain oatmeal (unsweetened) on my pre- and post- blood sugar levels
  Test:  I tested my blood sugar prior to consuming, then 30 minutes after consuming, then 1 hour after consuming.

 (NOTE: Comparison to brown sugar:  I detected a hint of sweetness, but saw 30 point spike in my blood sugar at 30-minutes).

In Beverages:
  The Test:  Again to test this, I used 1 16oz glass of Ice Tea with no additional ingredients (just loose leaf black tea I brew)
  The Product:  I added 2 tsp of the Coconut Sugar (2x the suggested serving amount) to my ice tea
  Results:  Much the same as above.  I found a slight color shift to brown, and no appreciable sweetening effect of the tea (it tasted no sweeter than just plain ice tea, minus the flavor profile shift of the Coconut Sugar).

  Comparison:  My comparison was (same as above) to check my blood sugar immediately prior to consuming and then 30 minutes after consuming and again 1 hour after consuming.  I found my blood sugar spiked slightly (15 points) with the Coconut Sugar as opposed to plain ice tea or ice tea (sweetened with 1 packet of equal (1g of weight).

  I did not test with sugar at this time, as I felt my results between the oatmeal test and Ice Tea test already indicated a sufficient trend.

C.  Nutritional Value - The claim is the low glycemic and minerals and nutrients.  According to the package's Nutritional information panel, the highest mineral concentration is Potassium (36 mg) followed by Sodium (5 mg) and rounding off the bottom:  Total Carbohydrate (4g) and Sugars (4g).
  (NOTE: To Compare, 1 average sized banana contains approximately 422mg of Potassium (13% of the DRA for an adult).

CONCLUSION:

For me, I find no significant value in using this product in neither management of glycemic tolerance nor sweetening of food and beverage.  While an argument can be made for Nutritional benefit, this benefit, in my opinion, is negligible.

Basically, I find this product to be a non-functional ""sweetener"" with an unappetizing food colorization and slight flavor profile shift that provided no discernible sweetness. As to nutritional value, I find this product worst of all) near-negligible nutritional value.

I don't find it a better option than just a balanced, nutritious diet.  I don't find it has significant benefit to diabetes management, and I STRONGLY URGE any diabetic to discuss the concerns of relying on this product to aid in diabetes care management with a licensed professional nutritionist/endocrinologist.

The only benefit I did find, is it was less taxing on my insulin/blood sugar levels than equal amounts of refined sugar.

In closing, these results are only self-observed.  However, the results did show me that, for me anyway, the keys to proper weight control/diabetes management is sensibility and moderation.",1.0,negative

"Received this unit on Nov 27th.
Very excited to be the first ""kid"" on the block with a 3D printer.
Unboxing and setting it up felt like Christmas had come early.  I even bought the glass build plate - to avoid the reported issues with the acrylic plate being out of true.
Printed out the Nut and Bolt test printable from the SD card. Worked great.
Printed the stretchy bracelet - again worked great.
Tried to print the little dinosaur and was good - right up until it got to the head and it looked like the poor little guy had an afro with severe bed head. Or was shot in the head. Take your pick.
Printing got progressively worse from there. Several ""air prints"", multiple mid print failures, etc.
after each failure I checked the build plate for level - it was.  I unloaded and reloaded filament multiple times.
Eventually the extruder would not load the filament at all.
It was completely occluded.
I went online to Makerbot support and found that I had contact support for that issue with this replicator unit.
Opened a support ticket on Nov 30 (Saturday). Did not get a response until Dec 5th (Thursday) . Granted there was a weekend in there but still I would expect something sooner than that for the amount of money laid out for this device. I also called and left voice mails on the support phone line asking for some kind of follow up. Twice. I finally got a response after sending a message via their facebook page.
So I did some more basic trouble shooting under the guidance of support and turned out I need to have the bar assembly replaced. Makerbot support shipped me a replacement assembly which I received on Dec 7th.
This is the process to replace: [...]
This is not something that everyone would want to do.
After replacing the bar assembly and getting ~5 minutes into a new stretchy bracelet I now get Heater Error #4 & Heater Error #5 messages displaying. The extruder refuses to get hot at this point and I can't unload the filament.
I called support back this morning and explained where we were at.. They suggested I disassemble the unit (again) and send them the bar assembly AND the motherboard from the bottom of the unit.
At this point I balked and said I'm not taking this apart again and removing even more components. I asked for a replacement unit to be shipped as I felt this one was defective and had done enough troubleshooting and repairs to warrant an exchange. They responded by saying that they don't have any inventory to do an exchange.
They sent me a UPS shipping label via email to have me ship this unit back for them to repair it and ship it back to me.
Expected turnaround time is 2 weeks (~12/23).
Merry Christmas.

So at this point, I am extremely disappointed with the unit and support. It has promise, and when it does work it seems to be great. 2 Stars for now.
I will post an update after I get my unit back.",2.0,negative

"This is great tasting water, probably in my opinion the best tasting bottled water there is as far as
unadulterated mineral water goes. I do love Smart Water Glaceau Smart Water, 33.82-Ounce (Pack of 12) for it's ultra clean taste but it is purified tap water.

As far as price goes, this seems reasonable considering they deliver it to your door.
But I also love my Zero Water Filter Pitcher ZeroWater ZD-023 23-Cup Water Dispenser and Filtration System and the clean water is produces from tap water.
It tastes even better. I can fill my plastic bottle made without hydrocarbons with
my Zero Water ice cubes and sip it all day, knowing that it is free of all metals and minerals. I like the little testing meter that came with Zero Water Filter Pitcher.

Fiji water tests at 132, Zero Water tests at 0. Which do you think is better tasting?
To come in at 132 for total dissolved solids makes it equal to some tap waters, without the chlorine.
Fiji tastes better to you than your tap water because most likely your tap water contains more than 200
ppm of dissolved solids.

I and my family did a blind taste test of Zero Water and Fiji water. We filled cups with each of the two waters, did not label them except on the bottom, water A and water B,
and each of the five of us tasted them without knowing which was which.
Zero Water beat Fiji for all five of us. I know this isn't scientific or representative
of what others might find but this is our experience.

We know hydrocarbons can cause cancer.
We know we have a tremendous problem with plastic bottles in land dumps. I see them thrown everywhere here in Florida, in all parks and scenic natural areas.
We know that hydrocarbons leach out of these plastic bottles when they are in heat,
such as when the un airconditioned UPS truck brings them to us. It bakes here in the Florida sun in the back of that truck, then I drink it.

I do love Fiji as a bottled water. I don't love drinking hydrocarbons and have found a way to avoid them, as well as heavy metals like lead, arsenic, mercury, sodium, hydochorides, etc. that are in most bottled waters to some extent. It's great knowing I'm putting water into my body that is free of all traces of these elements. As bottled waters go this one is tops for taste.

I like to keep some bottles of Fiji in my fridge along with some highly mineralized San Pellagrino San Pellegrino Limonata, 6 Pack - 11.15 Ounce Cans and some Smart Water. All of these are delicious in their own way.
I use my Zero Water pitcher for quantities of pure water when I make tea of coffee.

edit: I have read that this water is very alkaline and so I am mixing it with xylitol Health Garden Kosher Birch Xylitol 1 Lbs. Product of USA (Not From Corn)
as a mouth rinse. The alkalinity counteracts the mouth's natural acid, which promotes decay of teeth, and the xylitol remineralizes them. Alkaline is a good thing in water and is prefered for health benefits.

The website for Fiji water states that the bottles are BPA free. It also says that the bottling plant sits on top of the water aquafer, where the water is drawn up from deep underground directly into the bottles, without any type of processing at all. The water is not polluted by twenty-first century air or touched by human hands, it is simply put into the bottles. There is lacking any type of analysis of exactly what minerals are in the water but I have found on other sites information that there are a small amount of beneficial minerals in it such as calcium and magnesium.

Unfortunately, this water is not friendly to the global environment. It is estimated to take one quart of petroleum products simply to fly this from Fiji to it's final destination, for each bottle of water sold.
That's a huge toll on the environment. It's ridiculous actually if you stop and think about it.",4.0,positive

"Updated - 08/15/2016: I went to use the thing today and found that my smart phone had automatically updated to a newer version of the software. The new app is horrible. I had to log on with a username and password (WHY?) to use a camera attached to my phone. It was a very simple app and now it's needlessly complex. In addition to the needless login, it's bloated out with a useless ""home page"" that seems to only serve to advertise the company. Rather than focus on improving the quality of the images, they have focused on collecting user information via a login and self-promoting their products. I have removed one star from my review due to this app update, and after seeing the direction the company is taking, I can no longer recommend this product. Had I to do it over again, I would have bought the FLIR instead and added an aftermarket lens for closeup work.

Original review:

I bought this thermal imager for a variety of purposes, including imaging electronic components on circuit boards. For someone considering this camera, the first thing I would suggest is to visit the Thermal Imaging forum over at eevblog. There's a ton of information about various imagers from different manufacturers. I considered both the Seek and the FLIR imagers for my iphone device. I ended up choosing the Seek because I liked the idea of an adjustable focus. Sometimes when I'm imaging electronic components, I like to get close, and being able to focus at a close distance is an advantage. Note that Seek also offers an extended range version, which will give you better performance at distance at the cost of worse performance at close range. The FLIR is considered by many to offer better image quality, even with reduced pixel count.

Also note that you can choose either Android or iPhone/iPad operation. I chose the Apple version as I'm an Apple user rather than an Android user. In some ways I regret this decision, as the Android version can be connected via USB to a windows PC and thirdy party software can be used that generates better image quality than Seek's software.

If your iDevice is in a case that has any thickness to it whatsoever, then you'll either have to remove your device from its case, or buy a lightning extender to extent the lightning port down a little lower. Amazon has lightning extenders from a variety of vendors. I'm using this camera in an otterbox case with an extender.

Generally I've found the device to be quite handy. I've used it for checking electrical components, checking heating/cooling around the home, even looking at cylinder temperatures in an airplane. You may see claims that you can use it to diagnose plumbing leaks and/or see pipes inside of walls. I think those claims are a little exaggerated. I wouldn't expect to see anything but the most egregious leak, and while I can easily see exposed pipes, I can't see pipes inside the wall.",2.0,negative

"These Band-Aids were much better than a ""sheer"" version I bought a little while ago. These have proved to be very useful to both myself and the family.

Hubby has had a lot of good use out of them when he gets cuts and scrapes working in the garage or yard......he had a scrape across a knuckle and these Band-Aids did a good job of flexing when he used them to cover this wound over a moving joint - a typically tough place to get a Band-Aid to stick and flex.

I used one just yesterday when I stuck myself with a needle while sewing. The Band-Aid stuck well and did have some flex to it so I didn't feel constricted.

The pack comes with Band-Aids in 3 different sizes, so that is good - you can pick the best size to fit the wound. Great for kids bumps and scrapes as well.

These Band-Aids do stick well, and there is some tugging to get them started when you come to taking them off. But the pad part is good and doesn't get stuck to the wound.
The only downside I have found is that they don't hold up well when wet, and it is best to just change them if they get soggy. (probably better for the wound too).

"Recently, I purchased a Teas' Tea bottle (2 liters) of Golden Oolong Tea at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. It's exactly the same tea as offered here, except for the size of the bottle. Nice tea. Really smooth and mellow. Wonderful taste and a total lack of sweetness plus zero  calories, of course. This stuff is a great relief from all the sweetened drinks, including most available bottled teas. I'm glad to find some in these 2 liter bottles, but the smaller 16.9-ounce bottles would be equally fine. The important thing is to find it!

"Disappointing mix of nuts overall. Bought 4 of these, and have opened 3 so far. The cans are probably 90%+ Peanuts and Almonds. My wife likes Brazil nuts most, and in the first container there was only 2 of them. The second container had ZERO. The third container had 3 and 1/2 of them. Extremely disappointing. For Pecans there have been an average of 8-10 halves per can. Cashews have a bit more, maybe around 20 of them per can.

Overall the nuts have a good flavor. A lot of the almonds are toasted well, and the flavor really comes through. Just don't buy these cans unless you are fine getting mostly Peanuts and Almonds. Picking out a Cashew or Pecan is a pleasant surprise, not a regular occurrence. And if you manage to find a Brazil nut it's like finding one of Wonka's Golden Tickets.",2.0,negative

"This is my 4th and will most likely be my last SpinBrush. My 3 previous SpinBrushes had one common problem -- the battery compartments were not watertight, which resulted in water seeping into the battery compartments and corroding the batteries and electronics. Each of my previous SpinBrushes lasted anywhere from 3-5 months before conking out. In addition, the battery covers on these were very, very hard to remove (Removing the battery cover involves a simultaneous twisting and pulling motion).

I had hoped that improvements had been made in the design of the battery compartment in the latest incarnation of the SpinBrush. But, nope. It still has the same hard-to-remove battery cover and a battery compartment that's prone to water seepage.

To be fair, Spinbrush does do a very good job of cleaning my teeth. After every brushing, my teeth feel clean and smooth (I do the ""tongue test"" by running my tongue over them -- no grit!). My biannual dental checkups had been good while I was using the Spinbrush.

Until the problems with the battery compartment is fixed, I simply cannot recommend this SpinBrush.",2.0,negative

They are only 130 calories per cookie and have 12 whole grains or 14% of your fiber.  They are low in sugar with only 8 g.  Also low in salt at 3% of your daily amount, no transfat or cholesterol. Naturally Sweetened: rolled oats and wildflower honey for a touch of natural sweetness.

As far as taste, they are grainy with oats and the bursts of dark chocolate flavor.

"New England Clam Chowder is my ""save for a special occasion"" go-to-soup.

Progresso decided to make its Safe & Hearty soup easy to use, starting with it's easy open cap, almost a pop-top. Obviously, they supply all the directions you need for both cooktop and microwave, in English and Spanish. IMPORTANT: Be sure to let the soup cool after microwaving your bowl of soup. I prefer the microwave directions. In my opinion, the taste is equal, but clean-up is easier.

"Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard has been a staple in my kitchen since, well, forever.  I always keep one bottle in the frig and a backup in the pantry.  A wonderful hearty mustard flavor that has remained consistent throughout the years.  The squeeze bottle is very convenient for use on sandwiches, burgers, and hot dogs/sausage dogs.  Some people have complained the hole in the top is too large, but I have found it to be just the right size for dispensing this thicker mustard.  If it were smaller, I think the mustard would clog up in the hole.  Also, every bottle I've purchased has had a tight safety seal.

If I have a recipe that requires Dijon Mustard (such as a Dijon Chicken recipe), I typically purchase a glass jar of Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard and spoon the mustard out for measuring.  However, I do not like using the jar for sandwiches and similar food, as I've found the jar of mustard can become cross contaminated with mayo and other fixings when a single knife is used to make a sandwich.  (But granted, that is the sandwich fixer's problem and not the mustard's problem!)

"Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: ""You can work with me!""  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM.

I have been using this technique with other makes of ABS for a year now, and have had no problems.

Last night I put a print that was made using this BuMat ABS to soak, and this morning found it had fallen apart.  I printed out again, and kept track of the part in the d-limonene for a couple hours, and found that the surface had started to soften.

(Video Size and Quality was reduced to meet Amazons limits, Watch the full video on my YouTube GadgetClass channel)

The Carrera Precision comes in a few different varieties, all of which are just slight styling changes. There is a Titanium a Platinum, TF etc. They all use the same heavy cast metal body(not made of titanium or platinum) and stainless steel caliper parts. The metal case actually throws the balance off quite a bit. The build quality and accuracy is not all that great compared to the iGaging EZCAL. There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which renders all internal measurements inaccurate.

Summary:
I would stay away from the Carrera and get the iGaging EZCal for the same exact price. The iGaging EXCal was the clear winner in this price category

Cons:
~ There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which makes all internal measurements inaccurate. Watch my Youtube video showing this gap visually.
~ It just barely meets it's rated accuracy spec across the entire data set.
~ There is a lot of ""Slop"" between the ruling body and measuring body of the caliper which leads to a wide variation in measurement accuracy as you get closer to the ends of the jaws
~ Finish and build quality are lacking when compared side be side to the iGaging EZCal

Pros:
~ Fractional measurement (also present on the iGaging EZCAL)
~ Auto Off (Also present on the iGaging EXCAL)

"Are you tired of drinking diet drinks with artificial flavors and sweeteners? Then Zevia cola might be a good choice. This drink still contains caffeine which I indulge in occasionally when I feel tired or need a little energy boost. This drink seems sweeter than Coke or Pepsi but doesn't have an addictive flavor so you are less likely to over indulge. What is strange about this cola is that it contains nutmeg oil although the flavor is barely discernible. The great thing about this soda is that you don't feel guilty drinking it. You get sweetness without sabotaging your weight-loss efforts.

"""Pure"" life water.  ""Purified"" water... enhanced with ""minerals"" for taste.  It's water, and the taste is a vaguely salty aftertaste.

"I've been using Krusteaz since the early 1970s, when a friend brought back a bag from a trip to Oregon.  I lived in the midwest, and it wasn't popular or even available in many places back then.  I never realized pancakes could taste so good!  It beat my mother's recipe all to heck, and that was a pretty darned good pancake recipe!

It has always been the best tasting of all the pancake mixes, and the easiest to prepare -- you just add water!  Really, what could be easier?  I change it up by adding fresh or dried fruit, different flavorings (cinnamon, pumpkin, etc.).  It's like a blank canvas so you can add your own touches to it.  Good stuff!

The recipe has changed over the years, and it's not quite as good now as it was when I first discovered it, but it's still the best-tasting in my opinion.  I've never had an issue with the quality, and it has decent shelf life, too.

"I just finished my first spool of this stuff.  I love the color but I had a few tangles...one in particular that was responsible for wasting almost 1/4 of the spool since it caused a jam towards the end of a huge print.

For $29 I can get a spool of top-notch Atomic Filament's silver PLA that's made right here in the USA too.

I think $22.98 with Prime shipping is a fair for a decent printing Chinese-made filament....but not a dollar more.

"Undersized sheet, warped, wouldn't adhere to print bed. Waste of time & money.

I installed this curled PEI sheet using the recommended 3M 468MP adhesive sheet.  The first time I tried to use it, the bed started to preheat and the PEI warped back off the bed at the front and back edges when the adhesive warmed and the PEI returned to its curled shape.  I removed the bed and use a brayer to roll the PEI into the adhesive and did a test reheating.  It stuck a bit better for a few minutes then rolled off the bed again in the front and back.  It's completely unusable.  I never touched the PEI with my fingers to contaminate it.  I peeled the protective sheet and immediately applied the PEI to the adhesive.  I guess I'll buy Ultem sheets from an industrial supplier that I use, for about the same price and I'm likely to get FLAT sheets of Ultem so I can hopefully avoid this wasted time and effort.  I'll also get actual 12"" sheets instead of these 11.8"" sheets that are so small that my 6""X9"" print bed can only get one sheet out of this supposedly 12""X12"" sheet of PEI.",1.0,negative

"OK...  first off...  this is a vulcanizing repair kit... not a hard epoxy or fiberglass.  It is sandable when it has cured fro at least 24 hours (any earlier and it just shreds like a plastic shopping bag) but it does not blend or feather well.  When applying this product for a tub repair, you want to be fairly spartan with it because, like I mentioned, it is a vulcanizing epoxy, so sanding it down is not a good idea.

The main reason I gave this product a bad review is very misleading in what you get.  The description reads thus:

""1.06 OZ, Fiberglass, Porcelain & Plastic Repair Kit, Bonds Fiberglass, Porcelain, Plastic, Ceramic Tensile Strength 1500 Psi, Water Resistant, Handling & Set Time 30 Minutes, White Or Almond. This product is manufactured in China. Excellent for industrial and domestic use.""

But you don't get a fiberglass repair kit... you get an off-white 2 part vulcanizer (NOT glass resin) with a small piece fiberglass cloth in the kit.  Including a piece of glass matt does not make this a fiberglass repair kit.\\

I guess I need to learn to read better...  as soon as I saw ""made in China"" on the kit I knew it was going to be garbage, and I was not surprised by the results.

I own a small handyman business and if I would have used this on a customer's tub, I'd be repairing it again at my own cost.  Don't buy this product unless you want to incur the same BS results.  Just go buy a small fiberglass patch kit at the hardware store.  You'll be a lot happier with the results when you're done.",1.0,negative

"My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.

First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.

Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.

Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.

"I have bought this litter several times.  It does mask the odor somewhat and does clump very well.  All that said I gave it only two stars because,  it isn't any where near trackless.  As a matter of fact it tracks every where but I didn't notice it right away.  So why not?  Because it's basically just scented sand.  So the sand scatters and collects down into the carpeting.  I vacuum two to three times a week for cat hair and use a bagged vacuum so I didn't see it in the canister.
  I noticed it was sandy when I swept up near the litter box and again, well that happens with all litter when the cat steps out.  But one day when I was barefoot I noticed this grit in my carpet way out in the living room that I had vacuumed two days before..  I swept it up with a brush and yep it was the cat litter.  I checked every room and it was the same.  Any where the cat walked  it was like she had spent a day at the beach.  It also collects between her toes and sticks to the sides of the box much more so than other litters.
I have used Clump and Seal  since they first came out with it but I honestly think they've changed it...or I never realized how much the sand would scatter so badly.  I would rather deal with less clean up so sigh...back to square one in search of the perfect litter.

"Let me try organizing my admittedly not-so-great thoughts about this for the sake of you, the reader...

I can't recommend this brand of freeze dried strawberries for a few easy-to-pinpoint reasons:

1) Mold. Munching along, my hand turning a color reminiscent of Halloween fake blood when I made the mistake of reaching into the bag (do pour freeze dried fruit into a bowl/onto a plate, ideally in a space you can clean any dust up as there will be dust/seeds no matter how much care is taken to dry the fruit delicately!)... the simple process of grab, bite, smile, and swallow had steps 3+4 replaced by cringe+spit. That unforgettable taste of fruit gone bad was present in far too many berries. I blame this on poor quality control,and I blame poor QC on #2:

2) Sourced from all over the place... No thanks. There are plenty of berries right here in North America where their facilities operate (where they bag them and sell them at horribly inflated prices for fruit from all over the place with cheaper than dirt cheap labor and zero oversight in the end of the crops)...

3) Beyond the mold, probably again thanks to #2, the flavor varied wildly. That would be fine were this a wild-growing, foraged sort of crop... It is an agribusiness, though, and some were really tart, some bland, some fine, some bleh. Dust will happen regardless of the brand/farm, and seeds will definitely be loose (you should definitely eat them-they are the healthiest part of strawberries!)... but there should be some sampling done to ensure they aren't selling fruit that was picked too early or late-either is unacceptable.

4, well 3.5) There is a perfectly good, slightly less expensive (no fancy packaging or importing costs), very CONSISTENT alternative and it is a brand/place I honestly almost never recommend: Trader Joe's. Yeah, that place. The place I literally only go to grab avocados and bananas and occasionally repackaged cheese I recognize or repackaged buttery thin almond sliver cookies from Belgium before my doc told me to cut gluten out because my immune system was PO'ed at the stuff... It is now a place for avocados, bananas, very occasionally their whole milk strawberry Greek yogurt (partly because they have forks and spoons in two bags at the check out-smart people!-and I am often there around 2pm and haven't yet paused for lunch but my beloved nearby family hole in the wall restaurant closes from 2-5)... Now add dried fruit to that list, specifically strawberries and sometimes mangos; maybe blue/raspberries or even pineapple(prob not the pineapple as it hasn't been my favorite thing freeze dried-its liquid is its charm). Anyway, if you DO have access to a TJ's, a place I wouldn't pay a dime for 90% of the offerings of, well, I can honestly recommend you go, rip open a bag of theirs, see if the tartness level is okay by your standards, and depending on whether you can get there any time or it is a bit of a trek, get a few bags or enough for an apocalyptic scenario. Ah, and if you don't have a dish, have a vinyl or nitrile glove when you dive in unless you want to accidentally dust-paint anything your hand touches a rosy hue -the glove removal is easier than washing hands without touching anything between my eating spots and sink, I have found, though I usually stick to the tiny bowl method and have a couple alcohol or other hand wipes wherever I am, ready for immediate use once I am done with this messy snack choice.

Ah, I see people mentioning (in questions) things like smoothies... Not recommended: go for frozen or fresh if that is your goal-these are a tad powdery and entirely dry and lighter than a corn flake so their density isn't suited for rehydration in any means except perhaps w/cereal, the brief hydration of cereal, or maybe mayyybe yogurt though I would do fresh for that or even go for jam before freeze dried since the wafer texture would to me be off putting (just my 2; do your thing, whatever it is, so long as it is not harmful to others or ideally yourself!)

Natierra's folks, if you are reading this, consider local, easy to control quality-wise, produce. Berries are abundant in the US-all year, even, though summer is when they taste like berries should and cost normal amounts... My understanding is that you are like the gift wrapping department of JC Penney... Making the item's presentation more frilly isn't what we want w/food; if you are really confident, try clear bags... Charging $2 more (yeah, yeah, I know half goes to the store, but we are talking about pretty small amounts of fruit-fruit supposedly certified organic but much like cheap-o apple juice, who knows what the conditions are when they come here from three or four countries, a few CONTINENTS, even-without so much as a silica packet in the bag to prevent the boat's varying humidity from ruining the goods... Charging a couple bucks more, MORE AT ALL in fact, for imported berries than the US-berries from TJ's is pretty elitist and unrealistic, don't you think? You get cheap crops from people making less than a dollar every two days of sunrise tp sunset labor but charge more than people paid 20x that even when NOT totally abiding by labor laws? Importing tropical fruit is, pineapple aside since Hawaii has entire areas devoted to nothing but pineapple, okay...berries? Not okay. I am not the only one who prefers my food to be from a bit closer than Africa, Poland, etc (there were a lot of oddball places I don't remember all of but berries=US; otherwise you are wrecking the environment for massive profit when you can do like the others and contract w/US farms or at least US+Mexico if quantity is truly somehow an issue which seems false given how easily they can, w/a written contract, replace less profitable fruit w/berries for you as they did for TJ's)... Oh, maybe consider consistency for mangos, too... Would be nice if all of them were the FEW mm thick when dry, not one mm thick like the last couple bags I bought. Honestly, I hesitate to spend $5+ again for unpleasantly hard slivers thinner than almond slivers... The flavor is awfully hard to enjoy when crunching something harder than most ice.",1.0,negative

"I used to always buy Volvic water but then Amazon ran out of stock and other sellers start jacking up prices as much as $70 for 12 bottles. I was forced to switch to FIJI water since Amazon don't seem to be restocking Volvic water anytime soon.

This water is good, I wish it was smooth as Volvic water though. This water is great if you don't want to go to a less 'premium' water. The main reason I stick to these waters is because of the silica and how much better it is than deer park, poland spring, etc.

Overall I would buy this water again, I just wish it was cheaper.

"I was really anxious to try this stuff... Some time ago I gave up drinking so much soda and have been keeping old time ice water in the fridge a lot more often.  Water is the best for you, but lets face it, it's also very boring and you need a change on occasion.  These Dasani Drops are really easy to use with anything from a single glass to a big jug of water.  It mixes in an instant and the price is certainly cheap enough. I particularly like the fact that you can just pick it up and add it any time you feel like it, without making a whole bottle at once...  That being said, this stuff really doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste much like lemonade either.  And what flavor there is has a very noticeable artificial flavor to it.  Once again, not really a bad taste when you are in the mood for something stronger then water.  But at the same time you will not be able to add some ice and a straw and convince anyone that you went through all the trouble for the best either. Also, one thing I noted was that although they call this drops, I couldn't get it to come out as anything but a squirt no matter how careful I was.  Not really a big deal, but this stuff is very concentrated.  You have to be careful to just add a one second burst to a glass of water, or the artificial syrupy taste will be overwhelming.

In conclusion, a good thing to have around for its convenience and price, but still nothing like home made, nor a good quality powder either.. : )",4.0,positive

In a word.  Junk.  I suppose they would be fine for roach clips but that's about it.  The joint was wobbly so the jaws never line up.  The arms were ground down crudely for some reason.  There were grinding marks through the finish.

Aside from sealing dishes and such, I have used this to wrap loose pieces of food and even to cover a wet paintbrush and pan so I could take a break from renovations.

So why one star off? It's because of the completely awful cutter blade on the box! Apparently someone on the Glad legal team has decided an effective cutter is far too dangerous for the average person to handle safely. The blade is flimsy, clear plastic, barely extends past the edge of the box, and gets bent out of shape after a few uses.

"This is a great product and because it has no high fructose corn syrup a
little goes a long way. I admit too a sweet tooth and sourdough bread
made into French toast really hits the spot. The problem is many of the
more expensive brands (especially the buttery ones) use that corn syrup
and no matter how much you use it just doesn't get it. With this you can
use a third as much and when used with real butter it is really good.

The problem is the packaging. The one I got was the worst. They just put
it in a box with a few of those bubble pillows and shipped it out. When it
arrived the top was broken but fortunately the factory freshness seal was
intact and it did not leak although I had to re-bottle. Checking the label
showed the real seller and the culprit. Walmart! I stopped buying on line
from them some time ago due to their defective packaging. If it can be
broken it will be. From Salsa to bathroom cleaner the packaging is the

"These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.

These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.

As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.

Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.

I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kettle-Chips-Sea-Salt-Vinegar/dp/B000G6MBUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kettle-Chips-Spicy-Thai/dp/B000G6Q4GM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.

Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""",5.0,positive

"Just got my spool yesterday. I'm not thrilled with it so far. It seems weaker than other PLA or ABS I've printed with, and layer adhesion is pretty bad.
Overhang stability seems above average.

The description says print temperatures of 195-215. Even at 215 and 0.25mm layers, the layer adhesion was awful. I was able to snap parts off with very little effort. I'm trying a print at higher temperatures and 0.1mm layers to see if it makes a difference.

I tried ColorFabb's woodFill last week and absolutely loved it, so I decided to give this a try. The ColorFabb seems like a better filament all around. This filament has a definite shine to it, while what I liked about ColorFabb's was the nice matte finish and ability to hide layer lines.

Unless something happens to greatly change my mind, I probably won't be buying more of this.

UPDATE: I just tested the 220C, 0.1mm print. It looks quite nice, and layer lines were hard to discern. The layer adhesion was slightly better than before, but still poor. Thin pieces snapped apart with very little effort (using only the tips of my index fingers and thumbs), and larger chunks broke away not just between layers but actually cracked in pieces as well. This is not a high-strength material.",2.0,negative

"PureLeaf Iced Tea, Sweet with Lemon, 18.5 oz. (547mL) Bottle (6-Pack), by Pure Leaf.
It is not mentioned on the bottle, but the pureleaf.com website has it listed as black tea. The bottle says that it is brewed from tea leaves, not powder or concentrate, and that it does not use preservatives or added color. This is a very good iced tea, but too sweet for me, with about 45g of sugar per bottle. A little sugar goes a long way, so no need to overdo it. Processed foods in general contain more sugar than is good for us. At least it contains real sugar, and not HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup), which is definitely not good for us. Four Amazon stars.

"While other filament I've gotten from this supplier has been some of the best I've ever used, the black filament I received was exceptionally sub-par.  It looks like maybe there was some moisture in the extrusion for the spool I received or something.

I can barely use it in my printer bot and the prints don't come out very well because of the quality of the filament.  Hopefully my experience was an isolated one, but I'm certainly displeased with the level of quality control based on this specific order.

"I left an earlier review, but have to revise it now.

I loved this filament when I first got a roll a couple years ago. I bought a new one back in October (2016), and it seems like this new roll is much lower quality. The prints are still nice, but I've had more filament breakages with this roll than any other filament I've ever used. I'm probably only 25% of the way through the roll and I've had the filament break at least a dozen times. Sometimes it snaps at the roll, sometimes at the extruder. If I let the roll sit for a month, I can almost guarantee that the filament will be snapped inside the feeder tube the next time I go to bring. Lots of failed prints and wasted time.

I can't recommend this filament anymore, and will not be buying it again.",1.0,negative

It is so inconsistent that if you try to print something with low infill or single perimeters, it simply will not hold up. This is such a waste, do not even waste your time buying this. Look at a more expensive filament, $5 or $10 more dollars will be worth it when you are printing high quality prints that do not fall apart.

"Very disappointed in the sewn in tag that damages the seam edge when removed.  If you rip it out, you tear open the seam which gets worse with each washing.

I don't find them particularly greasy or oily, but they certainly are not dry roasted.  The peanuts don't have skins.

"I always keep a bottle of this in the fridge.  It's very convenient and makes a great marinade.  I find that it is best tasting when it is fairly fresh, so I skip the huge bottles and buy the 8 ounce bottles.

It's not just like a fresh lime, but in my area the fresh limes aren't always that great themselves and they are often about $1 each.
The secret to this product, to me, is using it when it's freshly opened and not letting it sit unused too long.  Then it is FINE.
I use it in salsa, pico de gallo- just SEVERAL Mexican recipes, and various marinades for all sorts of things, as well as to just squirt on food as it cooks sometimes.

"I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the ""big two"" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard ""bad things"" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.

But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.

Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called ""erythritol"" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol ""shouldn't"" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it ""supposedly"" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.

If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the ""bad"" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.",2.0,negative

I did not realize this was part of a diet program - it seems to be some sort of lose weight in a few weeks thing and that said - it might be fine for it's intended purpose. But I just wanted a high protein snack to replace the chips and cookies I love but don't need. I wanted to like them - I tried - and they are NOT flavorless like some reviews said - they have plenty of flavor but the flavor is awful! Truly. And if you can get past the awful flavor you have to deal with the chalky / gritty texture. I give them two stars for a great idea - but they failed in every other way.

"Based on the three five-star reviews I read at the time of my purchase, I gave this a try.  Two of the three reviewers were using it for the same purpose and me - Attaching a cyclone dust deputy to the top.  Here are the problems:
(1)  The bottom is convex so it does not sit flat on the floor.  I will be using the ""ONEIDA AIR SYSTEMS Super Dust Deputy Molded Cyclone Only"" on top, so I need a steady base.  Otherwise it will be too unstable.
(2)  The lever-lock ring is hard to close (it's very tight).  This is good for a one-time use of hazardous materials but not good for a product that will be opened to be emptied repeatedly.
(3)  It is very bulky as another reviewer mentioned, making it a poor choice for something to be picked up and truned over to be emptied repeatedly.
(4)  Mine came with a bent locking part on the ring.  Another example of poor Amazon packaging.
(5)  The lid is also convex making the seal to the dust deputy challenging.

The price of this durm is great and for another use it might be OK.  I will spend another $50 and buy the ONEIDA AIR SYSTEMS 17-gallon Steel Drum For Super Dust Deputy which is already drilled for the dust deputy.  I guess it's best to stick with a product that's engineered for that use.",1.0,negative

2) The heated bed MOSFET on mine was not wired correctly and burnt out the first time I tried to turn on my bed. I know that it wasn't my problem as I swapped it with a known good board and all was OK.

"I bought a large bag of these a few years ago to attach to my rain barrels. As of this spring, every single one of them is BROKEN. This is simply because plastic bulkhead fittings, when yanked on via the hose in any way, will break.

It states the cooking time is 10 minutes but despite following the simple directions on the pack, it took at least 15 minutes to cook properly, meaning other parts of the meal had to be kept warm and on hold while waiting for this pasta dish to cook.
I have cooked for my family of 7 children for years, and feel I can make a basic pasta side dish out of a packet without any trouble.

This dish just didn't live up to expectations. It was quite bland, lacking any real cheese taste despite being a ""four cheese"" side meal. Disappointing.

It wasn't horrible to eat, but it wasn't anything other than just passable either. From my experience with this dish I would recommend taste testing it during the cooking and perhaps adding some extra cheese or spices to it to your liking, to give it a lift.

"I'll just say right off the bat that this stickvac is not worth the price.

The 2 main complaints are that it loses the charge much too quickly and it doesn't pick up well. Both of these are obviously very important (missing) features. You need the vac to stay charged long enough to use it and you need it to actually pick stuff up.

This one seems to be very picky about what it wants to pick up and when. There is no sense of it because one minute it will pick up something a little bigger and won't pick up small stuff and the next time you use it, it will be the opposite.

When using it in the kitchen, it didn't want to pick up pieces of grass that had been tracked in by the door. This was not huge clumps of grass, not wet grass, not stuck to the floor grass... just single little pieces of grass scattered on the floor, maybe an inch or two long, at most. It doesn't like to pick up pet hair off of hard floors either. After running the vac, you can still sweep up plenty hair/dust/dirt with the broom.

Some cookie crumbs left by the kids were gone over several times and it still didn't want to pick everything up. Cat litter is iffy - sometimes it will pick it up, sometimes not, and regardless it will always spit some back out at you. No matter what you're vacuuming, it always seems to want to spit some back out at your feet.

The dust cup is small, so even if it does pick up, it can't pick up much at a time.

As a hand vac, it isn't much better at all. The opening at the end is pretty large and circular and it just doesn't do a very good job.

On the brightside, it is very easy to put together. You just attach the handle with a screw. I did it with a butter knife in about 15 seconds. It is fairly slim and easy to store. The swivel head is nice to maneuver the vac around. But, all of these good things do not matter at all if the vac simply does not do what it is supposed to.

For this price, I really expect something much better. The least it could do is work.

I cannot recommend this stickvac. Sad to say, the even more expensive model 240A isn't much better either. I'd scratch both of these off the comparison list and look to other brands.",1.0,negative

Same thing. Now I must say that the ones that are not over-roasted are absolutely delicious - crunchy soft oily deliciousness - but you have to dump out the whole bag and separate out the dark ones.

2-P10 is as good as any other CA glue for very small projects such as Popsicle stick crafts, and high gloss finishes for pens and other small turnings, and is more expensive than most brands.

"Well, I won't go as far as ""hate"" on this one.  I'll be generous and give it two stars.

First off, you have to know this is NOT a soda. It is sparkling flavored water.  I was looking for just that.
I love dragonfruit flavor, and thought this would be a nice thing to try.  They don't carry it locally, so I ordered it from Amazon.

We've tried it both right out of the can and well-chilled, and neither one passes the muster.
If you are old enough to remember Strawberry Nehi sodas, then you will be able to understand what I mean when I
say that this stuff tastes like a glass of carbonated water with a few drips of Strawberry Nehi mixed in.
There is zero dragonfruit taste, so I'd guess they tacked that on there to sound exotic and interesting. It is FAR from interesting.
There's a little bit of the strawberry soda aftertaste, but that's all.

I would definitely NOT buy it again.  I'll stick with other brands of sparkling water that have actual taste to them.
This was just not good, and would not recommend it either. Two thumbs down (or should I say eight thumbs down - no one
in the house liked it) for this drink.  Fail.",2.0,negative

If I were to purchase this product in the grocery store, I would avoid buying any damaged cans. If they are seconds there should be some warning in the ad.",4.0,positive
"Alright, when I first ordered this product it was through prime pantry and priced at $1.50 per container.

It's now selling for $17.23 per container.  Sorry Pine Valley Foods and Amazon, while it's nicely packaged and convenient to make, and very tasty to boot, it's still just popcorn!",2.0,negative

"I haven't found this filament to be as brittle as some other transparent filaments unless it gets cold.  Transparency is very good and so far it hasn't had any knots when unwinding.  Here's more information on the clear filament and the brittleness problem. Only the last few inches of the spool become brittle and the easiest thing to do is to unload the filament and just break off the brittle part. The white PLA does this as well and it's easy enough to work around.

But I discovered a bigger problem when I reordered the clear PLA, they sent a different filament which was translucent and not transparent like the last spool (calling it ""clear"" is somewhat ambiguous). I kept it sealed so I could return it, but they told me it would be the same after it was heated. They were wrong, the package is now open because that's what they told me to do, and they aren't responding to my messages any more. It's too bad, the original clear was good but I don't trust the vendor and will take my business somewhere else.

If you need a little bit more to it you can add baby spinach by the handful a few minutes before serving to let it wilt. Maybe even a dab of sesame oil.

The stuff you get in the supermarket is usually cut in perfect shapes that actually hold together which is another benefit.  Quite often I've had HORRIBLE cornbread over the years, which tastes like stale breadcrumbs, so luckily this Krusteaz honey-flavored cornbread is an improvement over most other brands.  Consider yourself very lucky!  I can only imagine how many people had to eat terrible tasting cornbread back in the 50's and 60's.  Wouldn't have been me, I can tell you that much.

"The instructions are outdated.  It's a minor issue, but not one that'll stop a seasoned electronics vet, but a noobie might trip up on it.  It has a few capacitors with higher voltage ratings than the instructions list.  For me or anyone not new to electronics, you can use the power of deduction and some common sense to figure out where they go.  No biggie.  Could cast doubt for a complete noobie who's just getting into electronics.  But like I said, minor issue.

The MAJOR issue on the other hand, is the front panel they sent me.  It's apparently for some other kit they sell because I had to drill out two of the slide switch holes and also the holes for the potentiometers.  (the holes for the banana jacks were they though, which is weird)  It definitely did not turn out as ""pretty"" as it could have had it been pre-drilled, but this is crap.  I'd ask for my money back but I had already decided to just drill it but after seeing the ugly results, regretted it since now I can't get my money back.  Apparently no QC goes into these.

As far as performance... it does work.  Fairly well I suppose.  The sine wave isn't very accurate at all.  Square wave is fine.  Ramp looked ok too.

So... all in all, if you want a good function generator, just get a ""good"" bench function/wave gen.  (Rigol and BK Precision have ""cheap"" ones that are pretty good for the price for entry level hobbyists)  It's not fair to compare this product to a real function generator, but it sort of is a fair comparison considering you can get a used Agilent, HP, or Tektronix waveform generator on ebay for $50-100.  The brand new Rigol ones start around $379 and they'll do arbitrary waveforms.  BK Precision has ones for $269, and a true DDS one for $309.  I'd recommend going with a used one on ebay or getting a Rigol or BK precision.

I'm not sure if this stuff is needed or how It uniquely cleans.  I wonder if flushing any white filament through dirty nozzles will show contaminants.  I know one thing through experience.

I can see the reason for most of the positive reviews, these still are better than the average paper towel, but if you're not familiar with the ones I find at retail locally, you might think they are ""normal"". I'm aware maybe I got an 'off"" batch of them, but I won't risk buying them again and the price really isn't close to any deal if you compare to how much more you get in the larger rolls for pretty much the same if not a lower price. And the consistency I get in the stores are a much softer feel and seem ""fluffier"". I'm a fan of the product but not this version of it.",2.0,negative

"I bought this to use in my existing Dial pumps since Amazon doesn't carry the Dial Gold refill in Prime Pantry and suggests this as a substitute. While the initial price is cheaper, the end cost is more expensive as it takes several pumps for each hand washing to get this soap to lather. I'll use about three pumps, but my kiddos get a handful. It also dries out my skin. I will say that the pouring spout is wonderful! There is no mess with this design and I wish other companies would incorporate it. It truly is superior. We bought the Free and Clear because of some allergies in our house and except for the issue of drying out my skin, we weren't disappointed on that end. So to review:

Pros: Excellent no mess pouring spout, no issues bothering allergies (Free and Clear version)

Cons: Takes multiple pumps to get a small lather, dries my skin

We clearly won't buy this again.",2.0,negative

"Im a librarian who has used Amazon since 1998 (when they only sold books and magazines) and this is the FIRST item Ive ever returned! Amazon lists me as being a customer ""only"" since 2000, but I used them before that for work/personal items.

THE SHORT REVIEW:

I plugged it into the wall AC after checking that it was set to 110 AC. This units specs are up to 30V / 5A.

I turned on the power switch and immediately the fan kicked in and the Voltage shot to 50.2V and the current went to 6.65A and the knobs had no effect of any kind.

I snapped a photo and typed a quick note to the seller (By4Easy) about the problem. The CV light was also on. The low switch only changed the current down to 3.3 amps.

A few seconds after sending the email I heard a large BANG and something blew up inside the unit.

This power source lasted less than 3 minutes.

After multiple emails over a couple weeks, and driving around town a bit I received a FULL refund.

THE LONGER REVIEW IF YOU'RE INTERESTED:

Youre supposed to use the supplied leads to short out the unit and make adjustments to the current / voltage but it was at 50v 6a and I was a little leery about that. I hesitated, but again, the unit was on for less than 3 minutes (more about that down below).

I emailed again and asked for a refund saying the unit blew up and won't turn, they asked for a photo of the problem.

I sent them the photo of the readouts at the super high levels (glad I wasted a few seconds taking the photo, or else Id have had to send just a photo of the unit turned off/dead).

They emailed back and said theyd send me a shipping label. It was a self ship. I paid $35 + $15 for this unit. The shipping from the Post Office was $39 BEFORE any insurance. The UPS store was just a little less, but still more than the unit cost me. That in itself shows that if you get a working version of this item it really is a DAMN GOOD DEAL! If

So, I wasted a day driving around to shipping companies, having them way this thing and measure the box and then quote some outrageous price. None of their weights, measurements seemed to match each other, but every single one wanted about $40 to ship this thing back home.

Having never returned anything in my past 18 years on Amazon I thought that was the end of it and itd just pull some of the heavy and nice seeming parts off this thing, but someone told me to re-email the seller. I did and a day later they emailed a new shipping label that was pre-paid. Cool!

They received (and signed) for the package after a few days. About a week later I emailed and asked about the refund. They emailed back and said theyd issue me a refund. Um, okay. Obviously they got the item back but did nothing about it. The next day I got a refund notice from Amazon and a few days after that the refund appeared on my credit card.

I am a librarian. Ive been using Amazon since 1998, back when they only sold books and magazine subscriptions. This is the FIRST ITEM IN 20 years Ive tried to return. I think this is only my SECOND 1 star rating since 1998. You can go see some of the items Ive reviewed/rated beforeI research and am generally very, very happy with my purchases. If the product is what is was supposed to be they get a 5 star, if  kinda sucks or I hate it for personal reasons it's a 4. I'm an easy grader, even though this review will sound run-of-the-mill whiney to many, that's not my style.

I knew this purchase would be a gamble because of all the reviews saying the power cords arrive with short circuits in them. I figured if that was the case I could just use a spare computer cord and throw away the one that comes with the unit. I would have rated it 5 stars if that were the case, but this just went to a deadly 6.6 amps (albeit, the promised 5 amps would be just as deadly I suppose-but not deadly to the actual unit).

The instructions say: turn on unit, THEN short out the terminals and quickly make adjustments. The supplied banana plug fell off the wire lead upon opening the package. Even if this thing didn't blow up I don't feel good about attaching (AS AN INTENTIONAL SHORT) cheap, thin wires to a RUNNING power supply blasting out 50v 6.6a. Yeah, I know people say that even cheap leads are good up to 10amps, but Im thinking: these people cant build a power supply, they cant attach the banana plug to a lead so it stays attached in shipping, Im going to trust my life/fingers to them? Anyway, there wasn't time: the thing just blew up sitting on the shelf with nobody touching it, thankfully. I supposed an experienced electrician would have immediately leaped across the table, shut it down and diagnosed the problem while disassembling it and simultaneously drinking a cup of coffee and doing a crossword puzzle. Um, yeah. Maybe. But with 50 volts at over 6.5 amps they/ I / we shouldnt have to and I'm more of a Lissajous Figure/Oscilloscope mellow type of guy. New to the higher voltages, lol.

Ive watched YouTube videos of people unboxing and using this SAME MODEL unit and they plug it in and it doesnt go past zero (let alone 50v) and explode. They plug it in, marvel at the cool red digital readout and then go on to whatever project their doing. Many owners weren't sure if the unit had a fan in it, yet my fan screamed on start up louder than my Dell desktop running Vista. Mine was special.

After unplugging the now dead brick I noticed 3 of the 4 screws holding the transformer to the bottom of the unit were loose. These are the screws sticking out of the bottom of the unit: I did NOT open the unit up. Did the transformer shift and short out something inside? I didn't want to peak inside since I was going to return this defective unit. I did notice the paint was flaking off the case near the almost all the screws that hold the case on. Had someone been playing inside this unit before or was it just a lousy paint job?

I knew that and gambled it would be a simple power switch, AC cable, AC to unit interface joint problem that people other were experiencing and then fixing. A fun, cheap way to get a power supply that you kind of fixed/modified yourself. Or heck, maybe Id be in the chosen few and get a unit that actually WORKED like promised.

Nope: I guess I got the NEW AND IMPROVED version that is shorted and runs at twice spec for a minute or two then explodes. It was LITERALLY less than three minutes by the time stamps on my photos and emails. Bummer, but for what I paid theres some nice parts I could have scavenged in the worst case scenario.

I noticed the instruction manual covers a bunch of different versions of this unit, including ones that go up to 60v. Maybe some 60v parts snuck into my unit-not enough to keep it from exploding thoughthat awful snap of an electrolytic capacitor (Im guessing) going off like a firecracker.

Honestly, 17 years on Amazon and there was a batch of cheap camera lens covers that fell off because they weren't true Canon size (which I gave a 3 star review); a bipod that arrived missing one of the two mounting pins that were supposed to be WELDED on (which I gave a 1 star review and repaired myself kinda sorta; and then THIS hunk of electric danger. [Edit: I have now made a SECOND return in 17 years on Amazon, because I was shipped a Counterfeit item-confirmed by manufacturer when I tried to register it-but that was not from this seller].

Thats about it for bad experiences in 17 years of buying for myself (tons of weird gadgets like spectroscopes, fancy telescope and camera stuff) and for libraries (books and office supplies). I wasn't even going to buy it and deleted it off my wish list, but I recently had an incredible run of some big, expensive and boring life purchases (mattress, car repair parts, medical bills, etc.) and wanted something fun.

Oh, you can see through the vent holes the less than stellar soldering job the boys in the FlingDung factory did. Its not horrible (what I can see) but you can definitely tell a human did the soldering and not a machinein a not so great way. To be sure, if you look inside the Elenco kit power supply that *I* soldered together a couple weeks ago youd probably laugh at a few things as well, but then again, you don't HAVE to look inside mine because mine WORKS.

Also, Ive only soldered 5 kits in the past few years and Id say the best of their soldering is better than the best of mine, but the worst of their soldering is way worse than the worst of mine. But then: I do not get paid to solder things and again, MINE WORKS! This does not.

My self-soldered capacitance decade box works fine! Along with the Geiger Counter in a coffee can (it raises the voltage when my ionizing uranium/uraninite test source is near, but does nothing with other rocks in my mineral collection and tallies pretty well with my real store-bought Geiger counter).

Are you looking for cheap parts or a possible mystery problem to figure out? Well, this unit is for you. Its very, very heavy and looks really cool. The digital meters wold look kinda cool hooked up to another (working) power supply if you want this thing for parts. There are course and fine adjustment knobs, which if ordered by themselves would probably cost as much as this unit.

The banana plug leads seem nickel coated, which is why the factory workers were unable to successfully solder the banana plugs and alligator clips to each end. DANGEROUS because theyll pull out and youll have a live wire dangling somewhereif your unit actually works. If

I opened the bag with the wire leads and a banana plug just fell out on its own. Ugh!

MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE KOOKY PHOTO I POSTED HERE (sometimes the Amazon phone/tablet apps don't show customer photos so you may have to use the browser version or a desktop computer). It shows 50V / 6.5 Amps. They were both a tad higher, but remember, a few seconds after snapping the photo something inside this thing literally exploded.

I suppose I could be angry/upset/indignant/etc. but I just chuckled. Also: THE SELLERS WERE REALLY POLITE in their various emails to me, and DID get me a FULL refund. However, this product is obviously junk and they really shouldnt be selling it until they fix the multitude of manufacturing problems they're continuously encountering in their factory for the past few years ago to some of the other reviews here.

Save yourself trouble and look elsewhere. Never buy anything that isn't PRIME / shipped by Amazon themselves / Fulfilled by Amazon if it was worth returning upon receipt of a defective unit. I lucked out and (after multiple prodding emails along the way) got a successful refund of ALL my money on this item.

Ive soldering up my own working power supply that is still working just fine. All I did was plug this unit in and it blew up. This was my first ever Amazon return in 17 years. I am jealous of people who just had faulty power cords, etc. that were easy fixes.

Making it at home is far less expensive than eating it out. Ask for it at a restaurant and it's like caviar. A 15 oz. can will serve 3-4 people, unless you love corned beef hash as much as I do. I could eat a whole can by myself.

If you've never had corned beef hash, do yourself a favor and don't smell it or critique the way it looks in the can until you've fried it up and served it with your favorite breakfast meal.

"This item arrived quickly... but upon opening found it to be packaged in a hand taped box, and within a 'jiffy' type bag crudely stretched over the beaker for protection. A small part number/bar code label on the box unceremoniously described the item as new.

Closer inspection revealed a series of surface scratches up around the interior mouth area; as if it had previously been stacked together with other objects.

This item also wasn't exceptionally 'clean', as one would expect to find a new factory packaged item.

Don't know for sure, but was definitely left with the strong impression that this item was previously returned and/or otherwise not factory direct.

I would have never bought it had I known... and probably should return it, but my time is worth more that the effort required to do so... and now have a 500ml pencil holder.

They're organic, sun dried and unsulfured. They're quite good figs but I've had better tasting figs and these are a little drier than most I've had. They also seem a little less sweet. That's OK.

"The printer worked fine for the first few months. The software must have gotten better since the last round of bad reviews. It's nothing amazing and it does fail to slice some stuff off thingiverse, but it usually does a reasonable job. The accuracy seemed pretty good and we enjoyed the parts it made for us.

However, after only 60 hours of printing (that's 20 or so parts on average), the heater in the head stopped working. It's still under warranty, but the company won't even give us the time of day. It's a brick now - or I'l have to void the warranty (which they don't support) to fix it, I guess.

The negative to the software is that if it detects an internet connection, it will automatically download and install the firmware without asking. That's frustrating, since I don't want to be the first adopter in the case of bad firmware (which the company has a reputation of having). They also apparently upload a log of everything you're printing and track your usage. That's creepy. Searching forums about issues, it sounds like they will also remotely disable your printer if you try to use 3rd party filament (by tracking serial numbers) OR EVEN IF SOMEONE ELSE USES 3RD PARTY FILAMENT AND USES YOUR CARTRIDGE NUMBER... That's crazy.

My single biggest fear is that apparently the printer will disable itself if it does get updates via the internet via your computer from the company. If they keep with the bad practices and go out of business... what will happen to all of us when the updates stop coming?

If you do happen to buy it... Just a few tips. Calibrate often. It looses calibration on shipping and periodically. That seems to make the prints come out well. Also, rafts do a TON of good. They help make it so the parts don't curl up when the plastic cools and also gives a good gripping surface when printing. Almost never misprinted if a raft was down.

Update: A month or so later - we've sent the company multiple emails and called them to ask for support on this machine. The company has not once answered their customer service line and are not returning phone calls. They also never respond to emails on any of their public email addressed. Concerning.

Update 5/2015: I've tried over and over to get a hold of someone at the company (Around 3 months of attempts now). I've had to seat and reseat the heating element connectors every few prints - and have had a bunch of prints fail. I've been trying to do only things that would respect the warranty, but this last time, the connector broke apart. Upon inspection, it became obvious that the connector actually melted. Finally, I had to cut the wires and install a better connector. Since the warranty is now void (which was useless anyway, apparently), I'm done buying their filament - from now on, 3rd party is the way to go. No reason to support the company anymore.

The hardware is still decent - sure, some small issues, but they don't support their devices to help get minor problems fixed. Somehow they managed to make an okay printer - but the company really is terrible.",2.0,negative

My 9 year old Daughter used it tonight and after she towel dried her hair, it too was frizzy looking all over.

We both have to add a leave in conditioner after using this.

As long as you follow the instructions (always a key to success in a lot of things), the rice dish is very moist and flavorful. I love that it includes orzo pasta, which helps to give the dish just enough al-dente feel, and adds to the overall moistness, even the attractiveness of the dish.

It's fantastic with chicken (just about any style of preparation), and also with pork (chops, roast). I confess I often prepare it alone, as a comfort dish. It's very satisfying.

I have tried the variations offered, and also some of my own. But my favorite way to enjoy this rice is without embellishment, just the way it is when prepared using the basic directions.",5.0,positive

"To complete various projects involving small motors and high output LED modules, I purchased five PWM controllers, including two of this specific module.  There was no documentation, so I was a little bewildered why neither of the two controllers worked at first with any type of load.

It is hard to imagine the logic of this design.  The switch isn't easily accessible or even visible with the cover still attached.  The perforations allow for manipulation of this internal switch but considering the potential damage to expensive equipment, it should be more visible with its status obvious.

I saw this on Amazon and was looking for items to fill up my Prime Pantry box so I thought I'd give it a try.  Have to say, I have been pleasantly surprised.  It's not the coffee I want every time but it's a good mild blend.

"Although I loved this syringe for acrylic bonding projects at first, it went bad quickly. I can't recommend it to others.

This is seemed like a great syringe, but it lost three stars for me because after about a half dozen uses in the course of two weeks, the rubber plunger inside now frequently pulls off the sliding piece when you backdraw it. That's pretty annoying.

I was using it for Weld-on 4 application, which is what the title of the item said it was for when I bought it (in case it changed now). So it's not like I was using it for an unadvertised purpose.

Because this went bad in a very short timeframe but was great before that, it's a solid two stars in my book. I can't recommend it to others for use as an acrylic bonding solvent applicator.",2.0,negative

"I read the package.  ""rich and creamy"",  it is not.  It's texture is chalky.  When it dissolves, it becomes a sugary texture.  No buttery flavor if you are use to real butter and cream.  Not what I was looking for and not what I remember as a good caramel.  Kraft use to be better.  They changed the formula to save money just as other big companies have.  It isn't good enough to be a substitute.  I'm going to have to make my own if I want the flavor and texture.",2.0,negative

"I admit that I am not a fan of any instant mashed potato brand, but this one is pretty tolerable when used as a component of a dish. Completely simple and fast to prepare, this is a good staple to keep on hand in your pantry.

My kids like to eat it as a standalone side dish, but I prefer these potatoes mixed into a recipe (topping off meat-and-vegetable casseroles, for example).

"I make this weekly in my meal preps for my breakfast every single morning.  Along with egg whites and spinach.  I use xylitol crystals to sweeten it, but you could use anything if you are not counting macros.  lol  It goes wonderfully with a bit of butter and pure maple syrup as well! Since this is the old fashioned type of oat, it's a lot thicker and holds up well in my weekly food preps.  I also add some golden flax seed, primarily on the suggestion of my nutritionist.  I don't love the taste of flax, though.  But you do what you have to do to get the results you want, right?

I can NOT think of a more economical food, that is a perfect fuel, you can eat every day and the cost is pennies a serving.  It doesn't hurt that studies show that oatmeal scrubs a bit of plaque out of the old arteries as well.

"These are absolutely the worst leads I've ever seen.  They prove that the ""cheap overseaas"" moniker is deserved and --astoundingly-- devolving.  The wire is maybe 28 AWG, _maybe_.  It's uncoated copper, pre-corroded (turning green/black).  The plastic coating is a bit rougher (which initially seemed nice, versus the previous el-cheapo leads with shiny plastic coating).  The clips are of course awful.  The clips are crimped (not soldered) onto the wires and coating, with the bared wires folded back over the coating...meaning that simply ""adding a dab of solder to the crimp"" (which used to work on all previous el-cheapo leads) no longer works and instead causes a molten, stinky plastic mess.

Beware this product; they've actually made what was already horrible much worse.  I'd send them back if it didn't cost more.

I find my opinion of Amazon decreasing as I discover they carry such total garbage.  And the clowns who write positive or blaise or non-critical reviews of technical products, well, maybe they should go overseas, too.  It pains me that such garbage products have been put into place and have put out well-made products, American or otherwise.  The commentator Gerald Celente mentions a ""Made in China"" backlash that's been long brewing.  Total garbage products like this junk frenetically propel that eventuality, but not nearly enough.  These leads are total, absolute junk -- build your own.  Get American made Mueller clips from Digikey and some real 22 AWG Teflon coated wire from Weico and save yourself the trouble, cost and aggravation of discovering Yet Another piece of total overseas garbage.",1.0,negative

"I'm nearly old enough to collect Social Security, so these beans came into existence during my youth.  As a youth, I remember them tasting smokey, with a little salt pork square in the can.  They were good hot, not too spicy, not too sweat.

Now, just last night, my Prime Pantry order arrived and I longingly looked at the can (I ordered 4), decided to open it and have some.  KETCHUP.  That's what it tasted like.  Not at all what I remembered.

Now, if you have the same experience, fix the stuff by adding just a few drops (no more) of Wright's hickory smoke, offered here at Amazon in quart and gallon sizes.  That's one of the best food purchases I've ever made, but it's VERY strong.  So only a few drops (much stronger and better than, say, Colgin).  Then these beans will begin to taste like they used to.

"Uh-oh - saw these peanuts contain cottonseed oil. Hadn't seen that on a list of healthy oils, so thought I'd better research it. Here's what Dr. Weill says when asked if cottonseed oil is okay?

Definitely not. As a matter of fact, in my book, Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, one of the first things I ask readers to do is to go through their pantry shelves and throw out anything made with cottonseed oil. I regard it as unhealthy because it is too high in saturated fat and too low in monounsaturated fat. What's more, cottonseed oil may contain natural toxins and probably has unacceptably high levels of pesticide residues (cotton is not classified as a food crop, and farmers use many agrichemicals when growing it). Be on the lookout for cottonseed oil in packaged foods and avoid products that contain it. Manufacturers like it because it's cheap, and products that say ""may contain one or more of these oils"" and list cottonseed, will almost certainly contain it.

In one oz. of these peanuts is 7g of protein, 22% of your fat, and 170 calories. Probably best to not eat and find healthier nuts without the cottonseed oil.",1.0,negative

"I'm re-writing my initial 1 star review after working with this device further.  I think this works as expected as long as wattage is below 500-600W.  The problem with it is it is rated at 2000W.

Maybe it would do better if the heat sink were optimally cooled, but I can only apply some fan cooling to it in my application.  Once it gets hot, it starts acting erratically and then clamps to full power and won't change the settings in response to potentiometer input; i.e., you turn the potentiometer all the way back, and it is still at full line power.

So I guess I'd give it 2 stars or maybe 3 since it is not defective, but its power capability is definitely over-rated, in my experience, without optimum cooling.  I don't know what it would be with optimum cooling, but I'm thinking less than 2000W.  I will be using the PWM on Amazon that sells for around $16.66 and is rated for 4000W.

"My husband continually asks me to buy this soap for him.  For some reason, he likes it.  But since this is MY review, and not his, I will tell you why I HATE THIS SOAP.

It's the most drying soap I have ever seen.  He has SEVERE dry skin on his hands and about a quarter of the way up his forearm - the area he washes when washing his hands.  And it's not just dry skin - it literally looks like he is growing a fine layer of soap in the crevices of his skin.  You feel his skin, and it has an odd...well...soapy feel.  This is just on the hands, but because he washes his hands often during the day (well, when need be...) this is what it causes.  He also uses this soap to bathe with, but since that's just once a day you don't notice a terrible effect.  However, I have run out of body wash a few times and been forced to use his soap before I could get to the store, and it LITERALLY leaves you feeling like you have a layer of soap scum on your skin.  Like you haven't rinsed, even when you have.  Like you need to scrape your skin down with a razor.  Really, it's bad.

Now, onto something that bothers me even more - the literally scum this soap lives in the sink and shower.  It's the worst soap I have ever had to clean up after.  After two days of not cleaning the sink, there is a visible and DURABLE layer of soap scum throughout.  Same with the tub.  He also uses it in the kitchen, and it doesn't seem to have the same effect on the stainless steel, at least.  But this soap is extremely difficult to clean up - I often have to scrub my bathroom with SOS pads just to remove the soap scum - and it's not because I go for weeks without cleaning, it's because this soap is terrible.

"What on earth did someone put into these to make this taste so bland? The premise is a nice one when pieced apart: chewy, granola, dark chocolate, pomegranate. But when combined? Blech, not a fan. I mean I don't HATE them, and since I already purchased them, Ill be finishing up the box, but I won't ever go out of my way to actually buy them. That being said, like most things, there are some good and some bad things about this bar  First off, it lists organic front and center on the label. But what exactly is organic? According to the back, EVERYTHING is organically produced with the exception of vegetable glycerin, sea salt, and something called natural flavor (vegan). There is a limited amount of fat (3g), but also a limited amount of vitamins (just 2% calcium and 4% iron).

THE GOOD:
-Organic is displayed all over it, and to its part 99.9% of the ingredients are actually organic. (Insofar as its certified by Quality Assurance International)
-With 0 cholesterol, it may be a good choice for someone seeking a crumbly bar, without much taste, that doesnt raise cholesterol Maybe for someone just seeking to fill their belly?
-3g of protein, which is more than probably half the other granola bars on the market.

THE BAD:
-It claims its chewy, but its definitely more akin to crumbly. By simply removing the bar from the wrapper, it falls apart.
-Its extremely bland. I get it, it uses a bunch of healthier grains and ingredients, but as someone who organically gardens That doesnt mean it has to be so flavorless and bland.
-Limited chocolate taste and absolutely 0 pomegranate taste. Chocolate is listed as the fourth ingredient and pomegranates at the seventh.
-Quite simply, it tastes bland, but also a little bit stale. Not a very appetizing taste.

THE VERDICT:
Not a good option for someone backpacking, as it crumbles at the slightly touch, so I cant imagine itll hold well crammed into a backpack. I think it would prove a decent option for someone wanting to add chewiness to their cereal, if there are such people on this earth, without adding a ton of sweetness.

"The rope is nothing special. It'll do the job I need it to do. However, what really ticked me off is that the manufacturer makes a point of emphasizing ""USA"" in the product description (""Rope King USA""), which might suggest to some that its manufactured in the USA. I'm the fool who failed to spend the extra time necessary to learn that it's not made in the USA. It wasn't until I received the item that I figured out the answer to that question. Says it on the part of the label not pictured in the product description  Made in China.

I've run in to the problem before. Although this particular purchase was intended for hardware use, this is the same type of rope my dog loves to play tug with. Just the sight of this got his tail wagging, but I had to say no. I won't give him rope from China. In the past, I've spent an untold number of hours searching pet websites for rope tug toys made in the USA, but no luck. I just don't get it.

I don't understand why it's so difficult to find rope made in the USA

My preference for rope made in the USA isn't political, rather it's a health concern. Manufacturers in China have given the world too many reasons not to trust them. One need only read the daily newspaper.",1.0,negative

Not only is there a great selection of products, it actually saves you money by keeping you focused on your shopping list and prioritizing the items.

Prime pantry removes the temptation of buying items, buy color, packing, or other sales gimmicks.

I had the ""Original Sonicare"" toothbrush for over 12 years.  It worked flawlessly.  Brush heads lasted six months.  The power button on the unit finally died.  This is the ONLY reason I bought the new unit.  Very disappointing.  Sonicare had a wonderful, original design and ruined it with bells & whistles and a cheaper concept.  However, the price went way up.",2.0,negative
"Although i got the right looking bottles with wide tip (from eclectic supply seller) these are the cheapest quality bottles i have ever bought! and they all look the same but, yet all have various number identification codes on bottom which are so roughed up/gluey like looking that i had to get a bright light and a magnifying glass to even see the hidden number codes that the melted plastic/glue like surface (that is also inside bottom of bottles and on side of some bottles where material meets to seal them close) is obsecuring. These are NOT all #4 ""Natural LDPE Plastic"" as listed, i received:
3 - #6 (POLYSTYRENE)
1- #4 (LDPE)
2- #7 (MIXED/OTHER)
6- #8 (last i checked there are NO 8's and these clearly say 8, so who knows what it is made with)

so out of bunch of 12, only ONE bottle is supposably LDPE. Don't know what others are receiving but, i personally can't see using what i received to hold liquids/etc that i will be consuming.. the only good thing about these bottles IF not for food use, is the caps close tightly and the dropper tips snap into bottle neck well and no leaks (except from tip hole itself). it is a shame the plastic bottles themselves are so cheap, they would of been great otherwise!",1.0,negative

I ordered all of the offered Dr. McDougalls soup/noodle cups.  I rated most of the 4 stars, but really didn't like this one.  The couscous has a strange texture and the flavor just is off.  I know it is low sodium, so my expectations weren't sky high, but I typically end up eating about half and then tossing it because I'm just not fond of the flavor or texture.

I like the other Asian flavored ones and the Pilafs much better.

"We had been buying Kirkland's mixed nuts and decided to try these. I found them a little too salty, although I'm glad they use sea salt. I also didn't read the print and see that peanuts were just under 50% of the nuts. The other nuts are almonds, cashews, brazil nuts, hazelnuts and pecans.

To be five stars for my taste, I'd lower the salt to 2-3% instead of 5% - then you could taste the nuts flavor better. The salt overpowers the different subtle nut flavors in here and they all taste about the same: salty. And I'd lower the peanut content to perhaps 30%, if possible. Might be fun to include some macadamia nuts in here, too.

If you like peanuts and you like salt, however, these would probably be a 5-star treat for you.",4.0,positive

"Are you tired of drinking diet drinks with artificial flavors and sweeteners? Then Zevia cola might be a good choice. This drink still contains caffeine which I indulge in occasionally when I feel tired or need a little energy boost. This drink seems sweeter than Coke or Pepsi but doesn't have an addictive flavor so you are less likely to over indulge. What is strange about this cola is that it contains nutmeg oil although the flavor is barely discernible. The great thing about this soda is that you don't feel guilty drinking it. You get sweetness without sabotaging your weight-loss efforts.

I purchased these here on Amazon and within a fairly short time period, I started itching!  What could be wrong with me??  I emailed my doctor in a bit of a panic.  Do I have worms?  Anal fissures?  Hemorrhoids?  AAAAHHHHH!!  The itching was intense and I had no idea it could be the wipes.  Other people use them without problems.  But then it dawned on me.  Could it be my beloved Cottonelle wipes?  So I Googled Cottonelle wipes and itching and BOOM, there it was.  Pages upon pages of stories and consumer reports of anal itching caused by the wipes.  Stories of people that have used these puppies for YEARS without problems.  Or they went through hell for years and never related the issue to the wipes!  Apparently it's narrowed down to one ingredient in the mix called MCI (methylchloroisothiazolinone) and is used as a preservative.  Well, Google that and this is what you are putting ON a mucus membrane!!  You may as well just pop it in your mouth.  No bueno.  Stay away.  I think other brands also use this same preservative.",1.0,negative

"My first impressions: this is a very intuitively-designed vacuum. I didn't need to pull out the instructions to figure out how to use the hose attachment. This isn't a complaint, just an observation: for this price range, a vacuum really shouldn't be made of lightweight plastic, but rather, some kind of metal. The Dyson DC50 feels cheap in my hands, compared to my most beloved Fantom vacuum (Dyson bought the company a few years ago). My Fantom is made primarily of plastic, but it's a far heavier vacuum, and simply feels more substantial with a bit of extra weight added to it. When you spend a lot of money on something like a vacuum, it should feel expensive. You don't want something cheap and light, and despite the fact that it's a good vacuum, this Dyson feels cheap and flimsy.

My other complaint is the inadequate size of the dust canister and the fact that you have to reach in and pull out gunk with your fingers. I wouldn't pay this much money for a vacuum that was so messy to use - my beloved Fantom vacuum has an enormous dustbin and when you empty it out, all of the dirt and gunk easily falls into the trash can. I thought there was something wrong with the Dyson until I confirmed with someone else who owns one of these vacuums that this is how this model of Dyson works.

Updated review:

After a serious workout by a professional housecleaner, who cleaned our house from top to bottom, this vacuum did not hold up under the pressure. The small chamber that holds the dirt filled up way too quickly, and despite the dirt chamber being emptied several times, the vacuum actually started spitting dirt back out at her, and then the filter chamber became so hot to the touch that she finally gave up, unplugged the vacuum, drove home and came back with her own cheapie $80 Hoover to finish vacuuming my house. The Dyson failed in the hands of a professional user who cleans houses and mansions for a living. If this vacuum doesn't work right after I put the washed and dried filter back into it (you have to wait at least 24 hours for the filter to dry), I will be calling Dyson to ask what my next step should be.

Update #2:

Dyson customer service is FANTASTIC. Yes, my vacuum is still broken, but after spending over an hour with me on the phone, ""troubleshooting"" the basics, the rep sent a work order to a certified Dyson vacuum repair shop. I will have to take the vacuum to the shop, and I'll post a follow-up update after it gets repaired and return to me. It was very nice talking to someone from the Midwest - probably Iowa, not a worker in an overseas call center who was reading from a script. So maybe Dyson has the balance figured out - the vacuums are manufactured overseas, where production costs are lower, but at least for now, their call center is based in the United States. Also, I was on hold for a while with Dyson phone support, and then given the option of waiting for a call back, which came in about an hour. So I give Dyson five stars for great customer service, and I'll revise my low star rating once I get the vacuum back in working condition.

Update #3:

This vacuum has turned out to be way too fussy, picky and demanding. Hair, dirt and gunk gets caught up in the mechanisms way too easily and then you have to do a first-aid rescue. Seriously, save your money and buy some other brand of vacuum. I hate it, and it sits alone, unused and unloved, in a dark corner. I've gone back to using my beloved 14+ year-old Fantom, made by a company that Dyson acquired several years ago. My housecleaner also hates the Dyson and brings her Wal-Mart Hoover vacuum, which she said only cost her $60. This woman is particularly handy at fixing just about anything, but she hates both of my Dyson vacuums. So do I.",1.0,negative

"These strips work very well, so well that I only used 10 at a time (out of 20 packets in 1 box). It took 10 days to see overall noticeable whitening. The first few days, only the bottoms (tips) of my top teeth were whitening. Just stick with it and you'll definitely see results. The instructions say not to brush your teeth beforehand, but since I used them at night, I always brushed and flossed first, then used the strips, then just peeled them off when done and went to bed, leaving the residue on my teeth overnight. Sensitivity was not an issue, and my gums only got burned a couple of times. There is a technique to applying these strips, especially if your teeth are not perfectly straight. You will get the hang of it after a while. These whitestrips definitely stay on your teeth, no slipping and sliding around. Great value!

"I'm the first person to give credit where credit is due. It is why I only rarely rate things with 1 star. Let me just put that out there before I begin.

I did not buy this product anticipating restaurant quality pad thai. That being said, there were so many shortfalls that could have easily been corrected. The sauce provided is incredibly thin, and if you've made pad thai before you know that the sauce should have a consistency reminiscent of hoisin sauce or slightly thinner. This sauce had the consistency of water at best. Maybe even oily water. Then on top of that they have you add 2 tablespoons of water. Which I did, although I was skeptical but for the sake of giving the product a chance I listened.

I was expecting a salty yet edible dish perhaps on the same scale as instant ramen from cup of noodles or something. The noodles come in what appears a vacuum sealed pound and retain their shape until you slightly massage them apart. They're somewhat uncomfortably slimy (for lack of a better word). They're a starchy mushy mess even after heating. The vegetables add absolutely nothing. Even if I were to fry up an egg I don't think it would have saved this. The best part about it was the small pack of peanuts that had a consistency and taste in line with what I know to be peanuts. Everything else, however failed to even slightly resemble anything that could potentially pass as Pad Thai.

Just don't do it. Seriously, I'm not that picky and I won't even try again. Annie Chun's noodles are better and they're a 3/10 at BEST.",1.0,negative

"Take a look at that image of the Brix/O.G. scales in the product description above.  Then plug some numbers into any online Brix-to-O.G. calculator.  Like this one:
http://www.brewersfriend.com/brix-converter/

What you see in your calculation will not come even close to what lines up on the refractometer's scale.  For example, 20 Brix converts to an O.G. of 1.083.  But the scale on the refractometer shows about 1.077.  A value of 30 Brix should be 1.129, but is shown as 1.117.  The higher the gravity, the more the two scales diverge.

So the question is this: Is just one scale off calibration, or both?  Your guess is as good as mine.",1.0,negative

Opened the box and it looks like a nice unit. Would not power on.
No big deal, let me put a fresh battery in it. Powered up and I thought all was good. Counters are level and the readout shows 0.00 so I was happy.
Turned it off and replaced it into the little carry case.
The next day I resumed working on the project I needed the level for.. when I tried to power it up.. Nothing. The display flashed then ""Err"" and after a few seconds it went off.

"This camera is not UVC-compatible. That is, it will not function as a generic camera device under most operating systems. It needs proprietary software/drivers to function, and they do not exist for Linux.

It also is very demanding for what it is. I was hoping that I could make a 1 photo/second time-lapse video on my old laptop (P4 1.8Ghz) but the laptop was too slow to keep up. My main computer ran a version of Linux, so it wasn't really possible to use it for time-lapse.

The image quality is poor. AmScope also makes DSLR->Eyepiece adapters. While they still have poor optics, they are much better than this camera. The lens used has a ton of chromatic aberration, which basically adds a sort of discolored halo to everything.

It also has no lens caps or anything like that. If you want the lenses covered while it is not in use, you must put it away in its product box, which is cumbersome. Maybe I want to keep it out but not damage the lens.

I will say one positive, however: It is well-machined and feels sturdy. The electronics and sensor hardware may not be terrible, but whatever quality is there is ruined by the awful lens.

Update:

So I've run into another problem with this camera. It *seems* like they intend for it to be flexible, since it includes both a Twain and Directshow driver, but there is a slight problem with both. The Twain driver always brings up a dialog and cannot be used silently. The directshow driver's problem is that it always defaults to auto-exposure. If you want to write a script that takes photos, for example, the camera will default to auto-exposure, and different image captures will have different exposure values, somehow even if the light source is constant.

This is a deal breaker for me. I need consistent exposure across photos. The viewer program that comes with it is fine and can do a standard 'time lapse' function with manual exposure, but I need something much more complex and there is no apparent way to make it work properly outside of the viewer program.

Keep in mind that the twain and directshow features are not actually very useful...",2.0,negative

"The best thing about this mix is it's fast and easy. Everything you need to know is on the back of the box. You don't have to measure anything. All it takes is 1 stick of butter, 1 egg, and a splash of vanilla extract. And you can actually go without the vanilla if you don't have any handy. With a bit of quick kitchen maneuvering (preheat the oven and get cookie sheets ready before you mix the dough), you can have the first batch of gluten free cookies in 15 minutes. That's not bad considering it will take at least 15 minutes to go pick up a box at the local store (if you have one down the street) when a craving hits and there is absolutely nothing to snack on in the house.
The taste is not completely homemade. Maybe it's mental, but I think all boxed stuff has a ""BOXED"" taste. But it is warm and freshly baked and you get that nice sweet aroma in the house. I don't recommend eating the cookies directly out of the oven because the GF dough needs to cool and set a bit longer than regular wheat dough. Instructions on the box indicate that a 2 minute cooling period is required. I think it's wise to follow those orders. I let mine sit a little longer.
The raw dough doesn't taste as good as regular cookie dough. The rice/potato flour mix is quite grainy and the dough itself is crumbly. I would not attempt to add it to my ice cream.
The recipe calls for butter. You CAN substitute with margarine but butter tastes a lot better.
I just made a box this afternoon. I followed the directions. I made 24 (3-inch) cookies and baked them for 10 minutes because I like my cookies brown and toasty with crispy edges. You don't have to brown them as much. The recipe say 8-10 minutes. I let them cool for 5 minutes then ate 3 with milk. Yum!",4.0,positive

"Vulkem brand not sold at local big box store.  I used this to seal around my vinyl window after initial installer's silicone caulk peeled.  I got a fresh tube and the sealant flowed out easily.  I used a battery powered caulk gun so I can't tell how much pressure is needed if using a manual caulk gun.  I know the label recommended using soapy water to smooth out the sealant but I used WD40 instead and it came out smooth.  Only time will tell if this holds up.

Update (1/2017):  During a rainy spell, window frame started leaking inside at the top of both ends.  Went out to look and this sealant had shrunk and peeled off the window at both ends.  This was caulked no less than a year ago.  I guess I'll go back to using 100% Silicone for windows from now on.

This stuff however, is like using extra wide Duct Tape. It doesn't want to pull away from the rest of the roll. The box fell apart as I was trying to get it started.

When I finally got some off I found while it will stay where you put it okay.  It doesn't want to re-seal onto the item you put it on. Meaning I had to use a whole new piece to cover my food again. Doing so deposits twice the residue from the adhesive. On glass or plastic it's hard to get off worse if it's textured

"Bought a Kenmore microwave in 2003 that served us well until the rotary motor stopped working. Saw good reviews on this one and it was just the right size so we ordered it from Amazon (Great price and super fast free delivery). So far, this thing has performed fabulously. It runs quietly (even the beeper isn't too loud), has great power and power distribution, and the door opener has, so far, operated smoothly and with ease (although we are holding our breath on this item in view of all the negative feedback we see on the door opener).

The only negative I have with this oven is the height of the cooking cavity. The advertised size of 1.6 cu. ft. is right but that size is mostly due to stretching the length and width and sacrificing height. The ceiling of the cavity is so low, we can barely get some of our larger drinking glasses inside. I am seriously doubting whether we would be able to get a large ham or turkey inside.

Only time will tell if this item continues to perform well. Foreign production, poor engineering and shoddy workmanship seems to be the order of today's manufacturing. I just wish we could get better response from our manufacturing base to get making things back into the good old USA with US labor which we need so desperately.

Update 2/21/2011:
Well, this appliance has let us down. It has been steadily going down hill since we started using it and my wife finally asked me to send it back; sadly, 1 day after the 30 day return period expired. It seemed to take longer to reheat and warm things and pop popcorn the first week we used it, and now it is definitely running out of power. It now takes at least 3 times longer to pop popcorn than when it was new and NEVER pops without leaving a large amount of unpopped kernels (it doesn't even have the power to burn the popcorn, no matter how long you let it run). The wife complains that it can't even soften a stick of butter in a decent time. Reheating food in either plates or bowls is frustrating. What a disgusting letdown. Good old foreign and cost saving manufacturing at work!!!

We are now paying a premium price to have our previous old reliable microwave brought back to life. It will certainly be worth it to get back to efficiency and reliability!

Update 9/16/2011:
My wife alerted me to something about when we were using this unit but I never knew until she told me recently; We have DirecTV and she said that she had noticed that when the TV was on and this microwave was turned on, the DirecTV receiver gave a bad weather picture and showed an alert that reception was being compromised. I couldn't stand this so, I took this thing out of the garage, where I had stored it for emergencies, and plugged it in. Sure enough, every time I turned it on at any setting, the DirecTV lost picture and gave a reception warning. This was a good 15-20 feet from the TV. This thing may have a dangerous microwave leakage problem and I am reporting this to the proper authorities. I have also decided to junk the thing to get it out of my life.",1.0,negative

"This is about the best tasting peanut butter around, and I like that it is fairly natural without much added except a bit of sugar and salt. However, the fact that there is no need to stir means that it has been homogenized, and that is hardly a natural process. It is a chemical process that involves fusing and changing molecular structure (in a nutshell), and these types of changes are not ""natural.""
Also, the palm oil in this peanut butter may or may not be ok. I am happy that it is not canola oil. However, there is nothing stating that it is expeller or cold pressed, and that does make a huge difference. Oils heated to high heat become rancid, resulting in the release of free radicals in the body. The beneficial properties are lost, and these types of oils can cause various types of disease. Generally, when the oils are cold and expeller pressed, the product would state such.
But this is probably one of the best compromises between taste, texture, and still being somewhat natural. So if you like the convenience of not having to stir the separated peanut butter and oil, and want something pretty natural and great tasting, this is a wonderful choice.

"This is a great product that improves if you follow directions and heat in the oven. Don't expect it to be of quality of your most gourmet Mexican restaurant but I've also eaten at many over price joints that were serving not made in house shells.
These shells are a hit at me house because toddlers can nor easily eat a taco that stands up. This isn't a big bonus for grown ups unless you fill your tacos so full you need help eating them. My husband them definitely isn't a grown up. He is guilty of this.
These are nice sized shells so you can get at least two meals out of one box if you Serb e sides like beans or salad.
The e tea bonus of ordering through pantry is they were $1 per box. That's right -- one buck. I just called my locallalu owners market and with tax the same
Box is $2.82. So, that's nearly one for the price of three. Makes it a super buy if you have prime.
Only downside is they are so big and the convenient design allows for a lot to be added, so you might run through meat quicker. The upside is they don't get soggy for a long time.

"This is the first time I've ever used gaffer tape, so I don't have much to compare it to. At first I was impressed- I liked the look and feel of the material,  it tore relatively easily and cleanly by hand, and seemed sturdy. Unfortunately, the adhesive is much weaker than any duck tape I've used. I understand that the tape is supposed to be easier to remove, and not leave residue, which was the main appeal of gaffer tape to me, but I still expected the adhesive to be strong. So I don't know if this is the fault of this particular brand of tape, or if this is how gaffer tape is 'supposed to be'.. Maybe more experienced users of gaffer tape can comment.

To illustrate, I've attached two photos of the peeling tape. I tried to repair the cheap vinyl (I think) fabric of my desk chair, which had several tears. I made sure the surface was clean, and pressed down all the edges of the tape firmly, but the peeling started almost immediately. In a few spots it's sticking well, but most are not- perhaps it only works well with flat, relatively smooth surfaces?

I still think this tape will be useful for other purposes, and I may add another star as I have more experience with it. But for now, based on this one repair, I'm disappointed in this product.",2.0,negative

"My name is William Hardin and I am....a peanut butter fan. There I have said it so I can relax now that the world knows. You will never find me without PB at home. There is always back up jars just waiting on the bench to be put in the game. That being said, because of the cost differences, I typically purchase the best value. In a perfect world my option of choice would be Skippy smooth in small jars. Every 5th jar would be Skippy super chunk. Super Chunk is good but a bit much for me all the time so I use it every so often.

So now the you know I like the product, why only four stars you ask? Because I am not the biggest fan of this size & style of container. The smaller the better so you prevent the PB from separating the oil or getting too loose.

"Sometimes it's nice just to open a can and not worry about the fat content.  This is nothing like real corned beef and hash, but the way I make it, it takes 3 weeks.  That's certainly not possible to enjoy often.

It's easy to just heat up a can and serve it.  I usually heat mine in a nonstick skillet- it can stick to other pans a bit.  If that happens, just soak the pan a bit and then it is easy to clean.

"First off, I have TWO of these units, the first I'd purchased from Amazon, the second was a replacement sent free by Amazon when I requested a return on the first due to accuracy issues. I also have several vintage weather stations, with USA-made, mechanical hygrometers which I trust to be fairly accurate. Those all read within a few % of each other. I have them in several locations around my house, but wanted a small, unobtrusive temp/humidity gauge for my daughter's room that wouldn't detract from her 'decor'.

To test the first unit I'd received I simply put it in my basement (where the humidity doesn't fluctuate widely unless it's raining) next to wall-mounted weather station for comparison. The 'Accurite' unit ALWAYS READS WAY UNDER the actual room humidity - sometimes as close as 8% under, but usually more, like 12% under.  The second unit I received as replacement acts much like the first, although their readings for humidity always differ from each other, usually they're as close as 2%, but sometimes as much as 6%, and it stays that way for hours (so it's not some sudden change like the furnace coming on that's the problem). I should note their temperature display is pretty close, within 1-2 degrees of actual - close enough to work with,  if only the hygrometer were as accurate.

The reviewer who claimed to have subjected theirs to a test chamber and praised it's resulting accuracy...maybe the hygrometers in these units only work well in a test chamber. I need something to work in my home, and a bogus reading of 39% when the actual humidity is 51% is pathetic.

FYI, while writing this review I found a website that shows up close to the top of googled results for 'hygrometer', 'nwclimate.org', that hosts an article titled '8 Best Digital Hygrometers Suitable for Your Home', with this 'AcuRite' model making the top of the list. Considering their numerous spelling and grammatical errors (even the article's title is awkward), and their (unintentionally lukewarm) recommendation of this unit, describing the hygrometer function as 'good accuracy if you are not interested in the exact percentage; for relative ranges it does a good job', I'd judge these devices to be the cheapest made and hardest-sold imported junk on the web.",1.0,negative

"This band-aids stays on very well...too well.  They will stay in an area that flexes, which can often pop off other band-aids, but when it comes time to get them off you will have a painful struggle.

I couldn't imagine using these on skin that has hair on it, as it would pull all the hair out...ouch!

There needs to be a good balance between a band-aid's ability to stay on and your ability to get it off again without a lot of pain.  This one falls too far to the former side.  Or they need to put a note on the box that says you need to use some kind of alcohol to get the band-aid off again.",2.0,negative

"This is another very good soup from Progresso. For those used to Campbell's Cream of Tomato soup, this is a big change. The soup is spicier, and there are chunks of tomatoes in it. Its not quite as creamy as the Campbell's made with milk, but it is rather thick.

Calories are in a good range at 130 per serving, and a bowl of this soup is filling. There is a ""regular"" variety of this soup without the high fiber content that is fewer calories still, but I like this one as I have trouble getting enough fiber in my diet daily. This soup will go well with a sandwich and still have a lunch that doesn't threaten the waistline.

"This came improperly packaged as another reviewer noted. That is dangerous as a crack could cause an explosion when the wheel gets up to speed. Mounted the wheel using feeler gages to get it as centered as possible on a 5/8"" shaft. The grinder and pedestal took off across the shop.  The wheel had side to side wobble of 3/16"" and a very heavy spot. The plastic nested bushings should be outlawed. Placed the original made in china OEM wheel on the grinder and no vibration.  The grinder shaft and flanges dial indicated to .006"" maximum runout, very acceptable. The Norton wheel is USA priced made in Mexico trash. Norton used to be one of the best. Amazon customer service was very good in handling this. They apologized for something that wasn't an Amazon fault. A return was issued immediately. I will continue purchasing from Amazon.

"In the past I have used scent boosters that I could still smell after the laundry was hanging up in the closet and I liked that. I decided to give these pods a try in hopes I would get the same affect, sadly I did not.

They did dissolve in the wash whether I was using hot, warm, or cold water. Out of the wash the clothes smelled amazing. Once out of the dryer the clothes barely held on to the laundry booster scent. The scent out of the dryer was not strong enough to make me want to buy these again.

As I type this review the laundry I pulled from the dryer is still sitting next to the bed two days later (don't judge me) so I just leaned over and took a quick whiff and there is absolutely no remaining smell from the scent boosters.

So where my other scent booster left my clothes smelling wonderful for days, this one does not. It is just not worth the expense of this product to have only a nearly noticeable scent upon pulling clothes fresh out of the dryer and then absolutely no scent two days later. I'll go back to my other scent booster - which happens to also be Snuggle, but in liquid form.",2.0,negative

I have one more can of this to use and maybe it'll grow on me but I doubt it. I just don't have much of a sweet tooth so this seems pretty syrupy to me.

As far as a snack goes or as part of a meal, I find this fruit bowl convenient and healthy (only fruit, juice, and ascorbic/citric acid).  I have eaten them both refrigerated and non-chilled; they taste like fresh pineapple to me either way served.

The second time I used it, I guess I didn't wait long enough and there were some hot coals, which burnt up the outer filter and also burnt the inner filter, while the suction did improve greatly, it didn't take long before it was clogged.  Once again after about 3 minutes it overheated again and shut itself off.  I can't really use it anymore as a ash vacuum and it doesn't suck enough to use as a shop vac, so Im not sure what to do with it other than throw it away.

"So far I've tried filament from 3 separate companies, and this has been the only one of the 3 I had problems with.  I bought the Chocolate Brown and the silver, both were wrapped so poorly that it failed prints simply because the filament was caught in the spool and couldn't feed.  But that's not the only problem I had.  I had actually paid someone to create a model for me and I had them do two reworks because the print would fail between 1/3 and 2/3 through - it would start getting stringy and trash the entire print.  I never had this problem before with this printer but I tried everything - cleaning it out, re-leveling it twice, etc.  After their 2nd rework he said there's nothing wrong with the model and suggested that I check my printer, I switched filaments to a Hatchbox spool.  It printed perfectly right out of the gate.  I apologized to the designer, tipped him for his trouble and vowed never to buy filament from this company again.",1.0,negative

"To be fair - I can't really test this product long enough to tell if it has a volumizing effect - which so far it doesn't - but again, can't test it any longer because this smells DISGUSTING.  Beware.  I love smelly soaps and shampoos, and it's very rare I find one I don't care for.  This has neither a floral, fruity, or clean soapy smell - it's smells like some cloying sweet candy gone wrong, and the smell is VERY strong - it ALMOST smells like something sugary that has been rotting away outside in the heat for a week.

I am not joking.  Haven't looked at other reviews to see if others agree - but believe me - this shampoo is just not worth it.  There are so many better smelling products out there.  I realize smell is not the most important aspect of a shampoo - but you know, one that makes you want to get sick in the shower is probably not worth your time.

***ETA - Just in case anyone is wondering what kind of nut I am - as far as other L'Oreal product go, I am absolute in LOVE with the smell of every other L'Oreal product I have ever tried, from their hair care to their facial products, etc.  It's not as though I don't like the general ""scent"" I associate with L'Oreal.

After reading many bad reviews about battery life I decided to actually open the unit to take a look inside instead of returning it(I am an electronic technician). I found a circuit board directly below the on/ off switch and what I found was interesting. A transistor on that board was not aligned properly when soldered at the factory. See attached images. After placing that transistor in place and re-soldered its connections, this thing works like a champ. I believe this can also contribute to the battery charging issues people have been experiencing.

"Apple cider is beneficial for conditions that can increase any signs of Gerd which may include Obesity, Hiatal hernia, Pregnancy, Smoking, Dry mouth, Asthma, Diabetes, Delayed stomach emptying. I insure to consume apple cider with water+grounded cloves before my workouts within the same time that I consume my power drinks with different seeds that I ground. Only USDA approved apples, produced in US, in glass not plastic container, organic, raw, not pasteurized, not heated, not filtered. Pasteurized is worthless since just like any type of pasteurized juice regardless of the fruit, vegetable, etc. lose nutritional values. This is apple nothing else, nothing more. Apples are a healthy part of my diet and apple cider is a convenient way of getting my daily organic apples rather than making a trip to grocery store on daily basis. Although refrigeration not a requirement, I refrigerate. I use a straw when consuming so I would avoid getting the mix on my teeth as much as possible and make sure to rinse after since vinegar can be very damaging to teeth enamel. No brushing for couple of hours till saliva has dissolved any trace of the vinegar.

I mix one part ACV with one part tap water, shake well and use it as conditioner even on the days that I do not shampoo. No commercial conditioner for me. The effects are so immediate that after applying the mix I feel the effects on my hair immediately in the shower. I insure to mix a little at a time and always rinse hair with coldest water possible since it adds volume unlike warm water which destroys volume, but shampoo it with warm water. Insure to keep the mix away from eyes and scrub the mix on the scalp for removal of any residue on hair. I do not shampoo my hair every single day since it damages hair and the natural oil of the hair and the days that I do, I add CO. Ricinoleic acid in CO helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO's omega-9 fatty acids can help. You can apply the CO directly on the whole scalp for few minutes, hours and even a day before washing it off completely with ACV.

Pour about 1 of apple cider vinegar into a tall glass jar, and mix in a couple drops of dish soap. Cover the top with a piece of saran wrap secured with a rubber band, and poke a few holes into the wrap. Fruit flies are attracted to the strong vinegar. They can get in through the holes in the saran wrap, but they can't get out. Refresh your trap every few days until you're not catching flies anymore.",5.0,positive

"This printer is a basic printer. It started right up with minimal fuss and only 1 minor adjustment that did not involve having to contact customer service. The heads were leveled correctly (something I've never seen on makerbot, flashforge or Wanhao and I have all 3) out of the box and all three test prints printed fine. The software is the weak link - its cumbersome and difficult compared to others but still quite serviceable and gets the job done better than I expected at this price point. I also have their AIO with scanner - its a useless paperweight and this is a MUCH better unit.
Overall I was pleasantly surprised given my experience with the AIO and an early model 1.0. Its not going to compete with models twice the price but at 600 and change it is one of the best in in its price range I've found.

Update one week later - Worked fine the first few days, lots of good prints. Sadly the software seems completely unstable. Saying the unit is inconsistent would be kind. The electronics are definitely sub par. Connections, even basic power up is intermittent after less than 30hrs printing. Its a shame - it would be a nice unit and worth the extra added price if they improved quality control.",2.0,negative

They did not go to waste.  I crushed them and put them in a crust of a Mexican pie I made.  That worked.

"I've kept a bottle of Tabasco in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit.  I've used it in Bloody Marys and added a few drops to many dishes I wanted to ""kick up"" a notch.

I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently. Huge mistake!

After a bit of taste testing I have to say Tabasco is one of the worse hot sauces available. Cayenne Pepper and a lot vinegar are Tabasco's major flavor notes. You can do much better! You won't miss all that bitter vinegar!

I could provide a long list of hot sauces that are much better. Here are just a few and I choose them because they are all widely distributed (sold here on Amazon and in your supermarket): Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce,  Cholula Hot Sauce, and Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce are all far superior. There are many others

Once you get away from Tabasco and its bitter vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are a lot of superior hot sauces. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco was first developed.

Update (August 2013): While my review was written some time ago - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS tested a wide number of hot sauces. What sauce came in last? Tabasco! First was the Huy Fong Sriracha.",1.0,negative

The chocolate tastes good. You should know that they are a little dry. They aren't crunchy dry, and it's not a negative comment either, it's just a good idea to have your favorite beverage nearby to wash them down with!

I put the word cookie in quotes because it appears someone at Nabisco made these things so soft they are more like nasty peanut butter cup than a cookie. What went wrong?

I think the problem is that they chocolate is misrepresented in this equation. The only reason people buy jars of Reeces Peanut Butter is because they are mentally unstable. These cookies taste sickly of the peanut butter with nothing to stop you from revealing the dirty secret behind it. The ""Peanut Butter"" they use could hardly be called a peanut butter. Sometimes I like to think I am trying something because I think it might be a good idea but I secretly knew they couldn't replicate the formula for cups into a cookie.

"Sweet Sugar Magic in Cubes.  I was enchanted by the use of cubes of sugar as a child, I still smile over those memories C&H could easily be called Sugar wizards in the sugar world. C&H Is a high quality 100% pure Cane Sugar. Sought  after by  bakers for it's great taste. It's a brand I have turned to for all of my sweetening needs for years now. When I found these C&H Sugar Cubes here at Amazon. I bought them right away.  Knowing the brand's name and the company's standards. As well as value I was getting compared to what I  would pay locally for this product.

I have found that these cubes are the answer when making fresh squeezed lemonade , also old fashion tea when you have family that like different levels of sweetness to they're drinks. I have also been using them in my iced coffee in the morning. I place two cubes in the bottom of my travel mug, brew my coffee pods ,add the cream and enjoy. No more dropped granulated sugar to clean up.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone who use sugar but wishes to watch just how much sugar they are consuming.

The filament going to my extruder keeps getting bound up in the filament remaining on the roll and ruining prints.  It has gotten stuck so tightly twice that it broke the filament at the extruder and was nearly impossible to pull out of the roll by hand.  This is not an issue with my printer.  The manufacturer either wound this roll too tight or something because it constantly bind in the filaments on the roll even when you unwind it by hand.  You can hear it constantly snap and pop as is gets caught and then snaps free.  The only way I can get it to print is to unroll by hand before the print however much filament I might need on this print.  Try rolling off 30 or 40 meter for a big print and then winding it back on by hand.  It works but it is a pain to say the least.  I sent a message to the seller several days ago and got no response.

"Review for:  Lutron 822-A Fully Digital EMF Meter

OVERVIEW:
-----------

Measures EMF strength of low frequency (30Hz-300Hz in this case) portion of AC MAGNETIC FIELD (NOT AC electric field, too) from ONE AXIS (direction) in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT).

Because cell phones and microwaves are in a much higher frequency range, this product does not measure EMF (RF) at those frequencies.  You would want a separate meter for that.

The Achilles Heal of this instrument is that the design is HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings. The accuracy is not 4% of the displayed value (+ 3 digits) but rather THE ACCURACY IS % OF THE VALUE OF THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT RANGE (4%x200mG = +/-8mG (+ 3 digits).  Since most consumer EMF checking is in the single and low teens mG, this is unfortunate.

This will do fine for noting the EXISTENCE of stronger EMF at lower frequencies, but appears to be a highly inaccurate choice for MEASURING it.

MAIN VALUE:
------------

- Measures EMF at 30Hz-300Hz low frequency range (Magnetic AC field only, not Electric AC Field), which covers most EMF generated by AC power in most homes/offices.  60Hz (U.S.) and much of the EMF generated by resulting harmonic frequencies .. 120Hz (2nd harmonic), 180Hz (3rd), 240Hz (4th), 300Hz (5th).

CONS:
------

- HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings .. a fixed +/- 8.3 milligauss (mG).  Since most suggested defensive limits for extended exposure are 1mG-2mG or so, this greatly limits its utility.  See paragraph above under ""The Achilles Heal of this instrument.."" for more detail.

- Measures only AC magnetic field (mG/uT), NOT AC ELECTRIC FIELD (V/m,mW/cm2, etc.).  Adding electric field measurement with decent accuracy would have added greatly to the cost.

NOTES:
-------

- Like other meters anywhere near this price range, the company doesn't claim this unit will filter out <30Hz and >300MHz EMF as well as academic/professional units like the Enertech Emdex II filters out EMF from outside its measurement range.

- This frequency range does not cover cell phones or cordless phone signals, microwave oven radiation, or other high frequencies often referred to as RF (radio frequency).

SAMPLE EMF MEASUREMENTS:
-----------------------------

There is no definitive consensus nor clear epidemiological evidence yet as to how much milligauss (mG) for extended periods could be harmful (within reasonable home/office real world levels).  However, there is a consensus from studies that staying under 1mG-4mG would be a good defensive strategy in case 20-40 years from now longer term studies (think smoking, etc.) start showing stronger causal relationships.  Most folks who care about this aim for under 2mG, preferably under 1mG, especially where pacemakers can be involved.

EMF METER SHOPPING GENERAL NOTES:
--------------------------------------

EMF FROM LOWER FREQUENCIES:

At LOWER FREQUENCIES we can measure magnetic fields (in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT)), and higher end units also measure electric fields (V/m,W/cm2, etc.).  Unlike higher frequencies where magnetic and electric fields are strongly coupled together, at lower frequencies you measure them separately.

As noted elsewhere in the review, for biological exposure it is suggested to play defense and keep prolonged exposure from lower frequency Magnetic Fields to under 1-4 mG (preferably under 1-2 mG) but there is no definitive consensus as to the long term biological dangers, and where the safety lines are.

Regarding Electric Fields of 50-60Hz (AC Power), there is some rough consensus out there to keep below 10-20 V/m and sleep at a spot below 5 V/m, though again opinions vary.  5 V/m was the recommendation in Germany and by the IRPA/INIRC for ""private individuals"", 10 V/m for ""workers"", with 25 V/m for ""workers"" for max. 2 hours.  ACGIH recommend 1 V/m for those with pacemakers or other electrically sensitive implants.

The fields in the lower frequency ranges are sometimes referred to as ELF (see chart below for usual acronym meanings of this sort), or even confusingly as EMF which is also often used to define such fields at most frequencies.

EMF(RF) FROM HIGHER FREQUENCIES:

At HIGH FREQUENCIES like those the high frequency meters measure, the magnetic and electric fields are coupled so strongly together that it is one field that is measured, usually in V/m or mW/cm2, etc.

For microwave ovens (2.45 GHz) biological exposure is often recommended to not exceed 5 mW/cm2 (milliwatts per cm squared), however again opinions vary.

Some school or hospital exposure limits for 300MHz-300GHz:
- France, Italy 10 mW/cm2 in schools
- Switzerland 9.5 mW/cm2 in schools, 4.25 mW/cm2 in hospitals
- Belgium, Luxembourg 2.4 mW/cm2

For RF Fields of 900MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 4.5W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.

For RF Fields of 1800MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 9W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.

The higher frequencies are often referred to as RF (radio frequency) frequencies (think cell phones, microwaves, etc.) and thus you'll see some meters with ""RF"" in the title or description.

MAGNETIC VS. ELECTRIC FIELD MEASUREMENT:

AC MAGNETIC FIELDS are much harder to shield than electric fields.  On the other hand unperturbed AC ELECTRIC FIELDS are much harder to measure accurately/dependably than Magnetic fields.  IEEE tries to help with IEEE 644-1994.  The inexpensive models don't pretend to measure this as well as the Enertech Emdex II's of the world, however they are often much less expensive and there's your trade-off.

Note that AC ELECTRIC FIELDS often remain as long as the the source is plugged in, whether it is turned on or off.

So for biological concern, what do people care about, magnetic or electric fields?  An engineer in the field that has been following this noted that in the 70's it was electric fields, in the late 70's and 80's it was magnetic fields, and now it's really both.  Most inexpensive units are only good for detecting the PRESENCE of stronger fields (vs. measuring them well) and many only measure magnetic fields, and if they do measure electric fields it usually isn't accurate.  If you need to measure accurately and/or measure both magnetic and electric fields, I try to help out in this review with some leads later on.

GENERAL:

Meters not designed for it avoid 0Hz since that is the natural ground DC static field and we usually want to ignore that for measurement.  Also there is often comparatively little EMF produced 1Hz-40Hz (some European train systems do FYI - 16.7Hz).  Thus meters often aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover below 30Hz-40Hz.

The frequency range of 30Hz/40Hz to 300Hz usually covers much of low frequency EMF produced in a home or office.  This includes the U.S. 60 Hz AC power frequency and 4 of the harmonic frequencies from that.  Thus we usually aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover over a few hundred Hz or so.  However, note that capping the upper end of the low frequencies in the low hundreds may fail to capture a good portion of CFL's EMF (compact fluorescent lights) if that is important to you.

Note that measured values can become less trustworthy as you get very close to the source of an EMF field, so measuring practically next to the source is often questionable.

Also note that pulsed EMF is usually not read accurately by EMF meters.

Note that if you need to take high radar frequency field strength into account (think Traffic Control Radar, Aviation, Naval, Military) because say you live near an airport and are wondering .. you'll probably need a meter that reads in the 8.5GHz-9.5GHz range.

Note:  I can't imagine who might work so close to one, but keep CFL bulbs without specific UVB and UVC mitigation (think double-envelope eco bulbs, for example) more than 20cm/8"" from people at the bare minimum.  If you don't know the technology of your CFL bulb, might as well play defense.

SOME ORGANIZATIONS REVIEWING
EMF/RF BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS:
---------------------------------

Here are some of the more scientific organizations with available EMF/RF research or overviews that might be of interest to you:

ACGIH - American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.
IRPA - International Radiation Protection Association
SCENIHR - Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (European Union advisory group).
INIRC - International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee
ICNIRP - International Commission on Nonionizing Radiation Protection
WHO - World Health Organization International EMF Project
U.S. EMF RAPID Program - 6 year working group put together in the past by NIEHS, NIH, and DOE.
NRC/NAS - National Research Council / National Academy of Sciences by way of National Academy Press
CA Dept. of Health Services - CA EMF Program
IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
VDB - Association of German Building Biologists (Verband Deutscher Baubiologen)

Further future related research discoveries are likely to involve, or at least be reported on, by one or more of these organizations as they have been involved in such research in the past (much of it you can find on the web).

HOW TO GET 3D READINGS FROM
FROM 3 XYZ AXES METER READINGS:
------------------------------------

While some tools take ""3D"" readings, to save money some folks buy meters that read 1 or 3 individual axes, not a composite ""3D"" reading.

To make a ""3D"" reading out of the individual axes readings you are supposed to put each of the three axis meter readings into the equation ""square root (x-squared + y-squared + z-squared)"".

However, here are some short-cut estimations for less demanding needs that some use:

Measurement Value:......Corresponding Guesstimate
1 High, 2 Low values....Use highest value
2 High, 1 Low value.....Use highest value plus half of second highest
3 similar values........Use 1.5x highest value

MEASURING SUGGESTIONS:
--------------------------

Consider/test:
- Keeping unit over 1ft away from any conductive material like metals.
- Putting unit on a non-conductive holder like dry wood or cardboard.
- Reading meter from 5 feet away.
- If measuring over a bed, measuring 2"" above mattress to take pillow into account and lessen the measurement effect of the springs (if there are any, of course).

SOME OTHER METERS:
----------------------

If looking for a high-end, accurate low frequency EMF meter, consider starting your research with these:

SPECTRUM ANALYZERS.  To measure EMF/RF field strengths AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES you will need a spectrum analyzer.  Some consultants use these for higher-end analyses, however there is usually much more expense and skill involved clearly.  Below is the maker of an affordable hand held spectrum analyzer solution you may wish to read up on..

(3) Aaronia AG Spectran handheld spectrum analyzer
I suggest reviewing their website for model options if considering these, there is a variety of models and bundles covering different frequency ranges, covering both AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields.  The U.S. Distributor is Kaltman Creations (Aaronia AG is in Germany).

(4) If you are considering spectrum analyzers and money isn't much of an issue you might consider reviewing Tektronix, HP, and Agilent offerings, too, perhaps others, just to know what's out there at the high-end if nothing else.  Of course, for most folks this is way out of budget and often skill set.

"The description and pictures do not state this come disassembled, only using the word ""kit"" to allude to this, which has been a major point of contention due to the tedious process of assembling the thermistor and placing it in the tiny screw hole in the heat block (under a washes shiny side down mind you!) without it breaking or having the cheap fiberglass sleeving fray. Its assembly is like putting two threads through 4 needles at the same time and trying to keep them all spaced properly at each step of the way while tieing a knot. This was not what i paid $80 for.

The hotend worked well for the few days i got to use it, then the thermistor burned up and was useless, unfortunately this seller, 3dmarkerworld, was unhelpful at first, offering to replace my assembled thermistor with a disassembled one, then outright sleazy when i decided it wasn't worth it to replace this low quality thermistor with another low quality one and wanted to return it, with them making excuses as to why i wasn't going to get a refund, saying because i assembled it i cant return it (amazon made them anyways).

On the up side when it was working it performed very well, and there are better themistors out there, metal stud thermistors, which don't require this painful assembly process and are far more durable. So if you are going to get this hotend check e3d's genuine resellers list, there are better resellers out there who care about their customers.",2.0,negative

"This is the worst gas can I've ever used!  Just received it tonight.  I temporarily working in CA.  Amazon shipping would not ship any other fuel container to CA, so I saw the great reviews and bought this one.  There is another traditional 5 gal fuel jug that says it's CARB approved, but they will not ship it to CA either!.

First, the lid mechanism is spring loaded to the closed position by two very large springs.  It takes quite a bit of hand strength to open the lid.  There is no way my wife or grandson could open it.  They wouldn't even be able to put gas into the container with these stout springs.

Second, the yellow funnel arrangement seems nice on first glance, until you try to use it!  It mounts to the spout on a 90 degree angle so you cannot get the gas can tilted enough to get all the gas out.  My cars fuel filler spout (and most others) goes into the car at a 45 degree angle.  If I tilt the gas can all the way (sideways/90 degrees) the funnel interferes and wants to pop out of the 45 degree fuel neck (the funnel then wants to point straight down).  I could only get maybe 3 of 5 gallons out.  I tried to turn it sideways but it will only go so far.  I finally was able to get 4 out of 5 gallons out while spilling it all over my shoes, the side of the car, and the ground.

There needs to be a way to swivel the spout for different filler neck angles.  They also need to reduce the spring pressure on the spout and maybe add a safety lock to hold it down instead of that 50# of spring.

Now the good:  Its made pretty well and the steel is not as thin as I thought by reading some of the other posts.  It is compact and at first glance it does not look like 5 gallons, but it will hold 4.95.

Find an older designed gas can at a yard sale instead of this new design.",1.0,negative

"I prefer less salty roasted nut options and this one was a great mix. The nuts are just lightly salted, which makes them more enjoyable for me.

The mix is mostly peanuts and almonds, but it had a good selection of other nuts.
-> The peanuts were good tasting, just lightly roasted, but not as flavorful as other peanuts I have tasted from Planters.
-> The almonds have a dry roasted flavor.
-> The mix has some walnuts and pecans, both mostly pieces but some pieces are quite large; walnuts were crunchy and dry, lacking flavor; pecans were less dry, almost buttery, but again lacked flavor.
-> There were few pistachios in the mix, but they were absolutely delicious.
-> Hazelnuts are sometimes hardly there, but I had some cans with decent amount of hazelnuts. Those had a strange almost `raw` flavor, most probably there were not actually roasted.

Overall I enjoyed having a mix of nuts (I used them for various recipes requiring certain nuts, not only for snacking). This review is for the

"Purchased as a spare part, failed after first use.  Works briefly if you tap on it... makes sparks.

This is one of those projects that takes an hour the first time, but is a snap from then on.  I have done it about 5 times and have it down to about 10 minutes.  You may have to cut off an existing plastic connector and use the included high-temperature wire nuts.

Our oven sees daily use and we have to replace this part every 12-18 months. I keep a spare on hand because it is, by far, the weak link in the design.  If anything goes wrong with the oven, failure to light, smelling gas at startup, I change out this part first.  Note, just because it is glowing does not mean it is working.  The gas valve will only open if the element draws a very specific amount of electrical current, and the element can be slightly high or low and the valve will not open, even though it seems to be glowing properly.",1.0,negative

I purchase these and was rather excited to have a go at this new flavor. I thought, how bad can this really be? I quickly opened the bag with that plasticky pop sound that only chip bags can make. Immediately the odour hit my nostrils-- my facial muscles automatically contorted in disgust. The parfum eu de gyro was pungent and ripe. The scent was some sort of forging of cheap chicken ramen and soured cucumber yogurt. I remained steadfast and moved forward-- telling myself that I shouldn't judge a bag of chips at the first waft of crisp fumes. I dove in, grabbed two chips and shoved them in my gaping pie-hole...... oh dear!!!. My guts churned in response screaming ""what have you done?!?!?!?!"" I was not going to be taken down by these chips. I chewed, smacked, licked my fingers, cleared my palate.... nope...definite no go. The after taste hit my mouth like Homey the clown slapping my chops with that red sock. If I ever had to guess what butt tasted like, this would be it. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth! I decided to make a run for the border.... I sat in the Taco Bell drive through and got some ""authentic"" mexican food. My goal here was to flush this vile taste out of my mouth and exercise these demon chips from my guts.... 22 min and 12 seconds later I was on my porcelain throne... mission accomplished.

"The instructions are poor, and sometimes in error.  And while you get a mini-DVD with the software on it, there is absolutely NO mention of the software in the enclosed printed instruction manual!!???  No mention of the form the data is logged in, etc etc. Worse yet, your slot type DVD drives won't read these mini-DVDs.  While there is a ""software download"" link on the Amprobe website they, of course, don't offer a download of the software for this device!!  The link in the review appears to only get you 32 bit software for the cable, and it is NOT the full software suite from Amprobe.  When you DO finally find a DVD reader for the enclosed mini DVD  you do find there is a significant amount of software on it, including some parts of LabView. AND, of course, the manual for the software is there, so unless you have a miniDVD reader, don't think about ordering this device.  You won't be able to use it.  Software is a little cumbersome install and there is NO support for Win8, but it least it appears to run well under Win8.  If you don't understand how the traditional Win7 functions map onto Win8 (and they do for the most part) you will have challenges with this software. Once you DO get it installed, the software is not too bad.  Allow at LEAST two hours to figure all this out.  To make this unit read accurately you have to calibrate and use the T/C offset function.  Some people have commented the specification was in error, and had too large a tolerance, but they are not  correct.  The K thermocouples supplied can have an offset of 2C at room temperature out of the box and STILL be in spec.  Out of the box without calibration my unit read ice water as 34F.  If you supply this unit with A/C power it gives no indication of whether it is on battery or using the A/C, but the ""APO"" (auto power off) disappears in the display.  But, of course, no where in the instructions do they tell you this.  This device cries out for a ""reset"" button but does not have one.",1.0,negative

"My family purchased these for many years for my stepdad to take to work in his lunch or to feed myself and my siblings. Now I buy them for those same purposes. I always find myself wishing that there was a more even variety of flavors in each bag. I don't know why there are more bags of some flavors than others. The small bags come in a larger plastic bag that has very convenient plastic handles, similar to the handles on garbage bags. This is great for when you're taking all of them to a picnic or event to feed lots of people, but kind of useless if you're just keeping it at your house to feed yourself and your family. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone, but especially large families. It's a great way to satisfy everyone in the family when they all like different flavors!",4.0,positive

"While I normally prefer the full sodium soups, I really do like this Progresso minestrone soup as well (though I sneak in a bit more salt or I mix it with another can of a full sodium soup).

This soup is pretty expensive in NYC supermarkets when not on sale ($3/can), so at less than $1.25 a can here and delivery right to my door, this is a bargain!

------UPDATE: 8-28-13-------

You gotta love Amazon.  When I received this order, they accidentally sent me the regular (full sodium, higher fat) version of this soup, which I did not want.  Although Amazon does not allow returns on supermarket food items, they issued me a credit right away. Way to go Amazon!",4.0,positive

Not disgustingly bad just slightly unpleasant. After air drying some of the laundry and putting it in a drawer for a week they smelled much worse.

For a long time I thought the smell came from one of my dresser drawers (the one I put delicates in that I air dry) and began buying some products that you put in your drawers to take away musty smells. They didn't help much.

I purchased a cannister and found that it mixes well with both soy and almond milk.  You can make a decent smoothie with it and it makes a hearty cup of hot cocoa.  Enriched with 12 vitamins and minerals, it has no artificial sweeteners or flavors. I would suggest using less than the package recommends and then adjusting for taste. For those who prefer the malty version, try either the classic malt or chocolate malt.  The maltines is understated in the rich chocolate flavor which,in my opinion, is an improvment.",4.0,positive

"The five stars is for the jelly only.  While the concept of being able to squeeze your jam or jelly onto your bread/cracker may be a good idea, in reality, the use of a squeeze bottle leaves a lot to be desired.  As others have written via their review, for whatever reason and especially after being open a few days, this grape jelly is nearly impossible to squeeze out even after banging the bottle on the counter to try and get the jelly down to the opening.  As a result, one winds up unscrewing the cap, removing it and using a long handled iced tea spoon to get the jelly out.  Entirely defeats the squeeze bottle concept.  The Smucker's brand has been around for eons and apparently to remain competitive with other makers of same/similar types of jams, preserves and jellies, went the cheaper high fructose corn syrup additive years back.  It is nice to see that the pendulum is apparently swinging back to using ingredients of yesteryear, i.e., more wholesome and natural.  I've tried Smucker's newer line of jams, jellies and preserves that are made without the high fructose corn syrup and they are much, much better.  Pricier - but you are what you eat and you get what you pay for.",4.0,positive

I couldn't imagine using these on skin that has hair on it, as it would pull all the hair out...ouch!

There needs to be a good balance between a band-aid's ability to stay on and your ability to get it off again without a lot of pain.  This one falls too far to the former side.

"I'm disappointed in this filament.  Its properties aren't too bad, it melts at the expected temperature. and adheres to blue painters tape and a previous PLA layer reasonably well.  The color is slightly more transparent than natural PLA but not enough to justify the extra cost.  Where this filament disappoints is in the manufacture.  The thickness is remarkably inconsistent, it's very wavy instead of smooth, and it isn't wound on the spool very well.  As with most transparent PLA, it is very sensitive to moisture and needs to be sealed in a bag with desiccant when not in use.  Where the end has been scored by the extruder gear, it will always break the next day.  And the extruder gear seems to have a surprising amount of trouble holding on to the filament.  I can't use this filament in an unattended printer and I frequently need to restart prints because of this.  I won't buy this again.",2.0,negative

My only negative observation is that they do not travel well.  I've ordered them on-line and also bought them at the local market.

It also contains a couple of things that I am not too crazy about: canola oil and acacia gum. I do not like the taste of canola oil, and I do not like gums of any kind added to my food.  Adding everything together, this soup could use some improvement.  I appreciate the good start, with 30mg of sodium, but they need a bit more sodium and spices to give the soup some taste.  As it is, right out of the can, I can only give this Health Valley Organic Potato Leek Soup two Amazon stars.

"They changed the package, fine.  It's bold and TOTALLY X-treme1!1!!!!!  dude.  Fine.

No, the problem is that they changed the FISH.

It's a different mold.  The fish are tiny.  And, the worst part... the recipe.  It seems like the ""cherry"" flavor is way overboard; it's so strong it's making my tongue numb.  It kinda tastes like chemical wood lacquer.

They New Coke'd Swedish Fish...  a candy I've loved forever because of what it was.  This isn't it.  So sad now.  :'(",1.0,negative

"This vacuum seemed really great, and I originally reviewed it at a full 5 stars. Many people seem to be reviewing the same way as well, quickly. I am sad to say, this vacuum actually started 'kerplunking' after a couple months, and rapidly declined to an unusable state. We ended up coughing and sneezing every time that we vacuumed. Eventually, people started saying that our house smelled ""dusty."" It was because of the vacuum.

My original review title: Sometimes you get MORE than what you pay for!!
SO sad. You actually do not get more than what you pay for with this item. Now, I realize, you should just pay a little more and get a quality vacuum.

We ended up spending about $200 for the Shark Lift Away, and it was AMAZINGLY high quality. After the first vacuuming, my mother-in-law came over, and instantly, the very first thing she said before she put her bag down was, ""You got your carpets steam cleaned?!"" My partner and I looked at each other and laughed. We told her we had just vacuumed with a different vacuum! No steam cleaners or shampooers at all. Just a one-time use of a Shark vacuum! I am not kidding you. The Shark Lift Away is incredible! It is worth it to skip this one and get a Shark!! --Or at least a higher quality vacuum in general. ...Good luck, friends! :-)",2.0,negative

"this vac picks up okay, it is satisfactory, not at all superior as most reviews claim.  It picks up well if you put a new bag after each and every time you vacum, just once.  And it started smelling up my whole house with a really nasty smell after the 3rd time I cleaned. I bout extra bags with the deodorizing tablets with I change each vacuum, but the smell is still unbearable.  I would not reccomend this cleaner at all. I say spend a ;little more and get a better piece of eqipment.  I am not kidding you when I say it smells horrible!  Plus I discovered I do want attacments, I thought I could go without them, but I have corners and places that need asn attachment.  It leaves a path close to the baseboards it will not get to.

Third and fourth plate holes to be drilled almost reached the 1"" Step, but again, not to the 1-1/8"" Step I needed. I used a Drill press, at a slow, steady pressure, to no use. No directions included. Didn't think of using ""coolant"". Didn't read ALL the reviews to find this out from other buyers.

"Very powerful toothbrush!  With the softest toothbrushes available, it made my teeth hurt for the rest of the day after the first use.  When I tried a ""barely touch"" method (actually, didn't even feel like I was touching my teeth) there was no pain, and my teeth came out feeling like I just got them cleaned at the dentist's office.  However, after a couple of months of use I no longer use this toothbrush.  For me there are two problems:
1.  I just barley feel the toothbrush on my teeth and yet this product causes my teeth to hurt for days afterwards, now.
 2.  I can't seem to get the toothbrush at the back of my bottom teeth at the right angle to clean them well.  When I tilt the tip of the brush downward the brush works, but the toothbrush handle is too long and it hits my upper mouth.  This strain and mouth contortions causes all the fluid to fall out of my mouth!  Sounds funny I know, and I suppose it is if you were looking at me.  That's ok, but the bottom line is that it discourages me from using this tooth brush.

I clean my teeth very well, normally.  But because of the above problems I started skipping the back of my bottom teeth and this is not good!

Conclusion:
This toothbrush does a great job on cleaning the teeth where it works smoothly, but the brush and handle on it are just too long to give individual teeth the thorough attention I like to give them.  I am going back to the round brush electric toothbrush by Oral B.  And forget the powerful ""sonic"" type system.  In my opinion, the tarter control electric toothbrush works just as well.  I just wish Oral B had softer toothbrushes, even their softest are not soft enough for me.",2.0,negative

"Out of the box it was hard to move from 0 and then about 2.5 inches it would not budge. I loosened the spring tension and now it moves but poorly. I applied instrument oil to the caliper rails and wiped it off and found the cloth dirty. This caliper was dirty. I also cleaned the rack and it was also dirty. While I can now move it from 0 to 6, it still is not anywhere smooth. The problem is you can feel the gears bind on the rack. The rack is either too close to the dial gears, the gears are too large or close to rack. By carefully adjusting both left and right screw on the spring plate I can go to 0 to 6 but only the first 3 and a half inches are decent. If you only need a caliper once in a while these will do. I have recently tried Harbor Freight at $18 and it was junk. After I returned the Tekton, I tried a Fowler 72-008-706 at $35, which is quite good.",2.0,negative

The honey they put in this juice doesn't do anything to sweeten it. There is no TASTE! At all. I thought this would be similar to Arizona green tea drink which is good but probably because this is so called organic it didn't have flavor. This would be good for diabetics or people who don't like sweet drinks.  Maybe their other honest tea drinks are better.

I should've read the description before I bought it so I guess its my fault because the bottle states that the honest tea is made to be only a tad sweet, well they aren't lying about that. They claim its made of all good stuff but it has caffeine in it and Im not a fan of that either. Left a bad taste in my mouth, it really does taste like brewed tea with no sugar or sweetener whatsoever.

"Not recommended.  It came in a vac sealed plastic bag, but it had a ton of moisture in the fllament.  Immediately after unsealing it and loading it up, the extrusion pops and hisses and bubbles as bad as I have ever seen.  The extruded filament is crunchy and foamy, and it's impossible to control flow because of the steam pressure created by the moisture. It also was prone to frequent clogging in my testing.

I ordered silver and gold, both rolls had this issue (and are promptly being returned).  I did not have this issue with a roll of natural ABS from eSun I got previously, so possibly it's an issue with certain batches.

As far as color goes, neither gold nor silver have any metallic or reflective qualities.  Silver is simply light gray, and gold extrudes to a dull ochre yellow.  The spools are big, but the filament unwinds over the sides easily.  Can't comment about diameter or resulting print quality, as they were basically unprintable.

"Agree, the claim of less than 50% peanuts does not appear to be true. There are certainly more peanuts in each bowl we pour out-about 65%-70%.

And what 's so great about sea salt?  Was wondering about that- is it really better?  Enclosed in the Mayo Clinic's review and you can decide. It seems that  may just be a marketing ploy, too.

_____________________________________________________________

WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEA SALT AND TABLE SALT?

Answers from Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.

The most notable differences between sea salt and table salt are in their taste, texture and processing.

Sea salt is produced through evaporation of ocean water or water from saltwater lakes, usually with little processing. Depending on the water source, this leaves behind certain trace minerals and elements. The minerals add flavor and color to sea salt, which also comes in a variety of coarseness levels.

Table salt is typically mined from underground salt deposits. Table salt is more heavily processed to eliminate minerals and usually contains an additive to prevent clumping. Most table salt also has added iodine, an essential nutrient that helps maintain a healthy thyroid.

Sea salt and table salt have the same basic nutritional value, despite the fact that sea salt is often promoted as being healthier. Sea salt and table salt contain comparable amounts of sodium by weight.

Whichever type of salt you enjoy, do so in moderation. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium to less than 2,300 milligrams a day  or 1,500 milligrams if you're age 51 or older, or if you are black, or if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.",4.0,positive

You do need to make sure that you stir the pasta as it cooks as the noodles tend to stick together for the first 5 minutes or so in the boiling water. I find that adding a tablespoon of olive oil helps out immensely.

These go really well with homemade Alfredo sauce, as well as simply garlic, olive oil, and your favorite vegetables tossed together.",4.0,positive

"I ate Kettle Chips for years, then stopped, and now have gone back to them having found the flavors that work for me. I liked the New York Cheddar but found them a bit sickening after a while then my interest was sparked again with their Salt and Pepper flavor and now Ive been working my way through the newer flavors. The Roasted Garlic is my current favorite.

Its a good thing for me to have intensely flavored potato chips (as long as the ingredients are identifiable as real food) as Ill eat fewer of them compared to your more everyday plain potato chips. The only caveat is that if you eat too many Roasted Garlic chips late at night on an empty stomach, you may end up lying awake for hours, being chased around your bedroom by a huge garlic bulb (OK, perhaps I was dreaming). The Red Curry is also well worth trying; the Dill Pickle and Backyard BBQ were interesting at first but not outstanding for me.

Im giving Kettle Foods 5/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. They use 100% green energy (either on-site solar and wind or through credits); convert all of their waste oil to biodiesel; had the first LEED gold certified (i.e. sustainable) manufacturing plant in the U.S.; support various causes from wetland conservation to hunger relief.

The last frontier that Kettle needs to reach is sustainable packaging. Im tempted to give them only 4/5 green stars because their packaging is non-recyclable and non-compostable. After all, Sun Chips (a subsidiary of PepsiCo, for goodness sake!) introduced a compostable bag back in 2009. The bag turned out to be hilariously loud but they improved the packaging to make it quieter in 2011. Boulder Canyon, who make really tasty chips, introduced a better compostable bag made from wood pulp. Recently, Oceans Halo began selling seaweed chips (which are interesting) in nice compostable bags, also made from wood pulp. So why cant you, Kettle? Hmm? Until you do, Im tempted to curb my cravings for fried potato by making them at home  slice, par boil for 10 min, pan fry in olive oil for 5 min, season. Hey presto!

Until Kettle come up with a compostable bag (please do this soon!) there is another option  you can recycle your chip bags by collecting a bunch and sending them to Terracycle (postage paid by them).",5.0,positive

I got Ziplock and Tupperware and plain old (better, actually) Kroger brand to work better.  These all have FLAT tops.  The GLAD bowl design is better, but that top is a killer and too much temptation for me to buy again until the top is fixed.

Okay, I need to use Bible's 1John1:9 (naming my sins to God, here of anger) every time I use these.  Thankfully out of the original group I purchased five years prior, most became damaged; so, I've only a few left.  THEY WILL NOT STACK because some dufus thought that center poptop was a good idea.  All these years have now passed and still the design is used?  So now it's the customer's fault for buying, no longer MADware's.  The tops wreck an otherwise quality product.  Hard to store, NO they don't clamp together, and NO they don't stack, so that everything wobbles in your freezer.

But YES they microwave decently (not for all foods and not for too long, but defrosting works well), and YES they hold up under repeated abuse straight from the freezer.  They are a softer plastic so not as brittle.  I don't like how the top ridge is so thick.. but I'd start buying them again if they got rid of that circle in the middle top and reverted to the old flat-top style which made you GLAD to use GLADware.

Okay, maybe I need 1John 1:9 again.  I name my sin of MADware aggravation, Dad. :)",1.0,negative

These have a line down the middle, which makes them easy to break in half, which is a good thing because my son usually drools them into a wet sticky mess before he can finish one. They are not as drool-soluble as some of the baby snacks on the market, but he still does a decent job of gumming and chewing them. Although, I usually end up throwing away at least 1/3 of what I give him. My daughter, who is almost 3, will also eat these.

"I'm seriously allergic to soy and finding peanut butter without soy has been surprisingly difficult. Most common brands add soy and a lot of the supposed organic brands do as well - this is entirely unnecessary, soy is considered one of the top eight most serious food allergies, like milk and shellfish. So far, Peter Pan has been reliably safe for me to eat and tastes great, but I am glad to find this Skippy Natural is soy free and provides another option.

My initial impression is very good. The peanut butter is creamy and smells good as soon as the jar is opened and there's no oily skin on the surface. It spreads easily on a slice of bread like it should. The flavor is good - peanutty with a little sweetness, but no burned or scorched aftertaste. It makes a perfectly fine sandwich with grape jelly.

The ingredients comparison between this Skippy and Peter Pan are pretty simple as well. Personally, I could care less about the type of oil because the absence of soy is a life threatening issue. Though the use of palm oil is absolutely not ecologically friendly and is the number one reason for destruction of the Asian rain forests.

Peter Pan: Roasted Peanuts, sugar, less than 2%hydrogenated oils (rapeseed and cottonseed), salt.",4.0,positive

"Apparently several varieties of cornbread are included under this listing. This review is for the Honey Cornbread mix  full fat. This is not my first box of this product. I use it when time is short and I need to pull a meal together quickly.

Taste is subjective which probably explains the difference in opinion regarding this product. Some people like jiffys (I dont) and/or love marie callendars (a family member calls it cake not cornbread), but I think Krusteaz is closer in flavor and texture to made from scratch.

On the box is a recipe using the mix but adding canned corn kernels, bacon crumbles, grated cheddar and chopped green onion. Chile was the plan for dinner so I changed the recipe by adding 1/2 cup cooked frozen corn kernels (dont like canned,) 1/2 cup grated cheddar and a tablespoon of dried red bell pepper to the mix. The mix itself requires 2/3 cup milk, an egg and 1/3 cup oil/melted butter.

Besides additional flavor, the extra ingredients also added texture and visual interest  all with minimal effort. I prepare the mix with oil (olive) rather than butter and the taste is fine, although no question butter would make it even more delicious.

The mix is slightly sweet and moist. I used the directions for high altitude. And, because I was using a dark tin muffin pan adjusted the temperature down to 395 degree instead of 400, and reduced the cooking time to 18 minutes instead of 20 and they were perfectly cooked. It is easy to overcook the batter and end-up with a dry crumbly result, so I always test with a bamboo skewer when it a few minutes before bake time is complete.

The muffins/cornbread freezes well although they should be consumed within three months which is when the taste will begin to deteriorate. Lately, although the regular cornbread mix is usually in stock at my local market, the honey cornbread variety is not always on the shelf so it is good to find it here. The best buy date on the box was fourteen months in the future.",5.0,positive

"I use a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush on a daily basis, but wanted something more portable for travel.  I had hoped this battery-powered toothbrush would be a good stand-in, but it is no better than manual brushing.

What a disappointment.  I wish I could have read the Panasonic operating instructions before actually getting it.  Step five says it all, ""Brush by moving the toothbrush in the same way as when you brush by hand.""  The real test is putting a dab of toothpaste on the brush and turning it on...outside your mouth.  Users will not see any toothpaste or toothbrush motion--just a buzzy sound.  Now try that with any Philips electric toothbrush--active bristle motion and toothpaste flying in all directions.

I'm confident Philips electric toothbrushes help with good oral hygiene.  My mouth feels clean after each use and dental check-ups have never been better.  You can get that same clean feeling with this Panasonic electric toothbrush too, but only if you brush well by hand.

Makerbot is the worst 3D printing company for many other reasons, but I see this as one of the most cruel. Here's why: Makerbot isn't primarily a consumer product, it's after companies and schools for sales. These Makerbots are under warranty to not tamper with their poorly engineered extruders (purposefully engineered to jam the filament upon unloading filament. You cant open it to fix it yourself, (which takes 20 minutes to do if you know how, done it myself) you have to pay 100$ for a pay per incident report, call in a repairman, or buy a new 'smart' extruder for $175 USD. These schools are also forced to only use Makerbot filament under warranty and I already explained that it was expensive, they are literally abusing this to suck funding from tech programs in schools. NOT TO MENTION the printers themselves are outrageously expensive, especially when there is a $200 USD Monoprice Select v2 with a HEATED BED that allows it to print in more than just PLA.",1.0,negative

"This product has completely changed from what we have purchased as Nabisco Honey Maid grahams in the past.  The box is the first clue as blue and a bit smaller.  But I really noticed the change when opening and trying a couple of crackers.  The consistency of this graham cracker is crisper and harder. Its taste is chalky, sweeter and missing most of the graham flavor.  It crumbled like sawdust in my mouth and i realized immediately something cheap had replaced the familiar ingredients and the recipe had changed. I went online searching for word of a recent change in the product as i had missed seeing any announcement.  What I found was a consumer affairs website with hundreds of complaints and comments about various Nabisco crackers including the Honey Made grahams.  Seems Nabisco has shifted making them to a plant and company in Mexico and people are filing complaints about the content, taste and some noted contamination examples in the products.  No one had realized they were buying anything different from the product(s) they had been used to when purchasing for years before and felt people should be made aware the products were not as they were and consumers depended on them to be.  Complaints included Premium saltines...which many of us had purchased for years, now crumbly, flaking off and tasting different... the Honey Maid grahams and Ritz crackers.  A number of consumers complained that the 'Ritz' they received smelled like motor oil and were inedible and smelled up their kitchen so tossed out immediately.  There were comments suggesting that was due to using rancid oil in making the Ritz.  All I know is my grahams were inferior, gave me a bad stomach ache i have had since yesterday and I called Amazon to complain feeling consumers should be given info the products are no longer the same and not from Nabisco in the US but now coming from Mendelez Int'; and made in Mexico.  I tossed the Honey Maid grahams and will never purchase any 'so called' Nabisco brand again ever.

It cannot simply be wiped off with a dry paper towel. When you wet it, it takes on the consistency of slug slime. It must be scrubbed with hot soapy water over and over. Then, you get white, water-logged boogers. Plus, you still have a sticky residue left behind. I gave up because my skin was sore. It also seemed to conduct the current irregularly.

"I've kept a bottle of Tabasco in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit.  I've used it in Bloody Marys and added a few drops to many dishes I wanted to ""kick up"" a notch.

I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently. Huge mistake!

After a bit of taste testing I have to say Tabasco is one of the worse hot sauces available. Cayenne Pepper and a lot vinegar are Tabasco's major flavor notes. You can do much better! You won't miss all that bitter vinegar!

I could provide a long list of hot sauces that are much better. Here are just a few and I choose them because they are all widely distributed (sold here on Amazon and in your supermarket): Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce,  Cholula Hot Sauce, and Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce are all far superior. There are many others

Once you get away from Tabasco and its bitter vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are a lot of superior hot sauces. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco was first developed.

Update (August 2013): While my review was written some time ago - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS tested a wide number of hot sauces. What sauce came in last? Tabasco! First was the Huy Fong Sriracha.",1.0,negative

"This kit failed to tell how to DISINFECT the faucet end BEFORE one took water sample in order to make the bacterial test legitimate. I got a positive on the bacteria, which scared me. BUT, it came out negative when the local public health re-did it. The Public Health kit requires firing (sterilizing) the faucet with a barbecue or cigarette lighter before ANY testing, AND to run the water for 10-15 minutes before taking samples for any test.

This kit does not give any such instructions, not even to run the water for a while. Since this is a water well test, the idea is to get the sitting water out of both your holding tank and your pipes by running for a while. That way you'll get to the ""real"" water as it comes from your well.

If you use this kit, without doing the above 2 things, your results will not be accurate, and you'll have to pay the regular price for a pro re-testing! (over $100 in my area)",2.0,negative

"Teas' Tea Unsweetened Lemongrass Green Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12), by Teas' Tea.
I am not very familiar with lemongrass, and all I can say about it, is that it gives the green tea a slightly minty smell and taste.  Not bad really, just a bit different from what I am used to.
This Teas' Tea is unsweetened green tea, and dried lemongrass, with Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).  It contains only about 1/3 the amount of caffeine in coffee.

The label says: ""Powerful antioxidants in tea help maintain a healthy heart and neutralize free radicals."" Five stars.

"If you want to add variety to your diet, this unsweetened blue diamond almond breeze is a healthy substitute to milk.  I use it on oatmeal and in my coffee.  There is zero sugar in this milk, and only 30 calories.  Only 1g of protein.  But it is rich in calcium, vitamin D and vitamin E.  25% Vitamin D, 45% Calcium, Vitamin 50%.  You can sweeten it with natural, no-calorie stevia.

I use it to make iced coffee mocha: one cup cold coffee, one cup almond milk, one cup low fat milk, 1 tsp. cocoa, stevia to taste and 8-10 ice cubes.  Blend in the blender and it makes 3+ cups of delicious drink for less than 200 calories.  Yum!  And it's all healthy for you.

Ingredients for this almond include:  ALMOND MILK (FILTERED WATER, ALMONDS), CALCIUM CARBONATE, SEA SALT, POTASSIUM CITRATE, CARRAGEENAN, SUNFLOWER LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVOR, VITAMIN A PALMITATE, VITAMIN D2 AND D-ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL (NATURAL VITAMIN E).

"I am an avid cook and baker.  Saran Premium Plastic Wrap is a staple in my pantry and the only plastic wrap I purchase.  I have tried other brands including Glad and have consistently found Saran Wrap to be far superior.

Saran Wrap is easy to use.  It's cutting bar cuts the wrap smoothly and the end of the wrap is easy to remove from the roll, doesn't get all sticky and impossible to remove like on some other brands.  Some of the comments mention that Saran Wrap does not cling, but I have never had this problem when using this wrap at room temperature, in the refrigerator, or in the microwave.

Keeps food stuffs fresh and wonderful to use to separate layers of freshly baked cookies and brownies stored in containers in the freezer.  I also use this to tightly wrap partially used fruits and vegetable like apples and avocadoes.  Saran Wrap excels at keeping these partially used fruits and vegetables fresh with no browning.

"I've purchased this product before and I recall it being pretty average -- not great, not bad. This time I'm not particularly pleased with the quality of the paste. It's too thick. It's too dry. It feels like old spoiled paste.

1) It's not shipped with a cold pack. Even when manufacturers claim their paste doesn't need refrigeration, decent manufacturers often ship with a cold pack. As no care was made in shipping this paste, I have to wonder how much care was made in storing it.

2) The needle that it comes with is relatively large, too large for any reasonable use on the projects I'm working on. I do have a bulk stash of smaller needles that I've previously used with other pastes (mainly zephpaste) with no difficulty. My smallest needle size wouldn't work with this paste at all. My other needle sizes required herculean effort.

3) It just didn't melt very uniformly and didn't flow ""right"". It's hard to describe, but when you've done this a few times you know when it's working right and when it's not, and this time it just wasn't working right. I don't have confidence in the work I did with this product. I had to spend a lot of time retouching under the microscope and I still don't have confidence.

This product just didn't work out very well for me this time. I wish I'd have spent the extra money to buy better quality. Maybe I just got a bad batch as other reviewers seem to give it raving reviews.",2.0,negative

"Got this spool based on the reviews, but it didn't work as praised.  Yes, it was working perfectly fine at first, but then it took a turn for the worse. I don't actually know how much filament comes in the spool length wise, but according to my Davinci printer, I've used 190 meters.  Well, the filament now comes out stringy, and makes popping noises when being extruded.  Humidity should not be a factor because the printer is set up in a climate controlled room.  I switched the spool and installed the Davinci filament cartridge, and that works perfectly fine.  I think I got a bad batch. I wish I could get a completely 100% good filament spool, but it seems to be hit and miss.  Because of that, I just can't recommend it.

Edit March 16th, 2015:

IC3D contacted me about the filament spool that went bad.  They quickly sent out a new spool of black filament as a replacement free of charge.  Their communication and customer service is TOP NOTCH in my book.  As soon as my current spool of filament runs out, I'll pop in the new one they sent me.  If it performs half as good as their customer service does, I'll be a happy camper and adjust the rating immediately.  Thanks again, IC3D!",2.0,negative

"This is great tasting water, probably in my opinion the best tasting bottled water there is as far as
unadulterated mineral water goes. I do love Smart Water Glaceau Smart Water, 33.82-Ounce (Pack of 12) for it's ultra clean taste but it is purified tap water.

As far as price goes, this seems reasonable considering they deliver it to your door.
But I also love my Zero Water Filter Pitcher ZeroWater ZD-023 23-Cup Water Dispenser and Filtration System and the clean water is produces from tap water.
It tastes even better. I can fill my plastic bottle made without hydrocarbons with
my Zero Water ice cubes and sip it all day, knowing that it is free of all metals and minerals. I like the little testing meter that came with Zero Water Filter Pitcher.

Fiji water tests at 132, Zero Water tests at 0. Which do you think is better tasting?
To come in at 132 for total dissolved solids makes it equal to some tap waters, without the chlorine.
Fiji tastes better to you than your tap water because most likely your tap water contains more than 200
ppm of dissolved solids.

I and my family did a blind taste test of Zero Water and Fiji water. We filled cups with each of the two waters, did not label them except on the bottom, water A and water B,
and each of the five of us tasted them without knowing which was which.
Zero Water beat Fiji for all five of us. I know this isn't scientific or representative
of what others might find but this is our experience.

We know hydrocarbons can cause cancer.
We know we have a tremendous problem with plastic bottles in land dumps. I see them thrown everywhere here in Florida, in all parks and scenic natural areas.
We know that hydrocarbons leach out of these plastic bottles when they are in heat,
such as when the un airconditioned UPS truck brings them to us. It bakes here in the Florida sun in the back of that truck, then I drink it.

I do love Fiji as a bottled water. I don't love drinking hydrocarbons and have found a way to avoid them, as well as heavy metals like lead, arsenic, mercury, sodium, hydochorides, etc. that are in most bottled waters to some extent. It's great knowing I'm putting water into my body that is free of all traces of these elements. As bottled waters go this one is tops for taste.

I like to keep some bottles of Fiji in my fridge along with some highly mineralized San Pellagrino San Pellegrino Limonata, 6 Pack - 11.15 Ounce Cans and some Smart Water. All of these are delicious in their own way.
I use my Zero Water pitcher for quantities of pure water when I make tea of coffee.

edit: I have read that this water is very alkaline and so I am mixing it with xylitol Health Garden Kosher Birch Xylitol 1 Lbs. Product of USA (Not From Corn)
as a mouth rinse. The alkalinity counteracts the mouth's natural acid, which promotes decay of teeth, and the xylitol remineralizes them. Alkaline is a good thing in water and is prefered for health benefits.

The website for Fiji water states that the bottles are BPA free. It also says that the bottling plant sits on top of the water aquafer, where the water is drawn up from deep underground directly into the bottles, without any type of processing at all. The water is not polluted by twenty-first century air or touched by human hands, it is simply put into the bottles. There is lacking any type of analysis of exactly what minerals are in the water but I have found on other sites information that there are a small amount of beneficial minerals in it such as calcium and magnesium.

Unfortunately, this water is not friendly to the global environment. It is estimated to take one quart of petroleum products simply to fly this from Fiji to it's final destination, for each bottle of water sold.
That's a huge toll on the environment. It's ridiculous actually if you stop and think about it.",4.0,positive

"Hollow cylinders, these apple cinnamon straws have a good crunch and a one ounce serving looks like a lot, but like many snacks, they are not filling. The base for the snack is an assortment of flours  corn, rice, wheat, oat, barley and potato. Following the order on the ingredient list, sugar falls between the oat and barley flour with apple puree and flavoring further down the list.

The fat level may be 30 percent less than potato chips (7 grams versus 11 grams) but I am having trouble seeing this as a positive thing, or for that matter understanding the thinking behind this snack when there are other less processed options with no fat grams, like dehydrated apples.

Further nutritional comparisons with potato chips reveal the same level of carbohydrate at 15 grams, sodium is a little better at 100mg versus 180mg with chips, sugar is one gram higher with these sticks and the rest of the breakdown is the same between the two snacks.

Regarding flavor, I like cinnamon but sometimes it has an almost perfume/air fragrance taste. Hard to describe but it is instantly recognizable when encountered, which is the case here.  And, it is more prominent than the apple flavor which fades to the background.

The product is edible but I do not like it enough to buy it again. The bag in my prime pantry box had a best by date nine months in the future.",2.0,negative
"I just bought one identical from Walmart, under the name (12"" Schwinn Roadster Trike Red)  price $74.97 + Sales Tax:  $ 4.20  Order Total:  $ 79.17, free delivery pick up in the store. The seller in Amazon has overpriced $18.98 compared with Walmart.
My Grandchild 32 months old 39lb at 38""high has 2 bikes:
1 - Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike, Red
2 - 12"" Schwinn Roadster Trike,
He is using both under my supervision, so that's my Opinions:
Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike, Red
Pros: Solid Built, almost immune to the corrosion, very good torque to the Active Wheel 9""diameter vs. 2.4"" length of pedal arm.
This provides a smooth pedaling, and easier to go up heel, and control going up through inclined sidewalks.
Cons: The center of gravity isn't to low, and combined with ""The pedal always free spin backward regardless of the locking position"" makes it impossible for the kid to control the speed, using pedals, to slow down, going down through inclined sidewalks. This bike has no brakes, and pedals are the only defense for the kid. So this is a very serious safety flaw.
12"" Schwinn Roadster Trike.
Pros:
Solid, built, with very low center of the gravity, no free spin pedals, and wide range of the sit adjustments.
Cons:
This Trike is prone of corrosion if it is wet, or kept in humidity higher then 60% for long time.
With active wheel 12"" diameter, vs. 2"" length of pedal arm, this has 50% torque compared with, Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike.
This makes hard to pedal on the grass, up heels, and for long rides creates a lot of stress to the kid's legs, unless the surface is strong, flat and HORIZONTAL. Any time we go for a Ride, after 50 feet trip, mu grand son stops, turns around, go back to the home, drops the (12"" Schwinn Roadster Trike), picks up the (Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike, Red) and enjoy the ride. Why: because 12"" Schwinn Roadster Trike creates too much stress on his legs.

"Not the strongest, most vivid Jasmine Rice I've ever tasted, but a very solid contender.  Clean, fresh, unquestionably the right strain of rice, but some of the imports have this beat flavor-wise.

Definitely recommended though if you want Jasmine Rice as a rare treat, and not as a semi-staple.",4.0,positive

This is one of their favorite brands and flavors.  They are 95 and 89 years old and they find cups of this each morning uplifting.  Both of them are often tired, even after just arising for the day.  A few cups of this in the morning allows them to begin their day feeling more awake.  My mother-in-law can even drink a cup with dinner and not have any trouble sleeping that night.

"Sellers use smoke and distortion about product accuracy in the listing. Poor accuracy in the device.

Listing hides understanding by reporting accuracy as ""+/- 2%"". Correct units would be plus or minus degrees Fahrenheit or Centigrade.

At their website the misinformation continues, reports this same %, as either plus or minus 2 degrees F OR C, which are completely different. I think what their sales people mean is that the true temperature when the device reads 100C is somewhere between 98-102C.

This would translate to the Fahrenheit scale as 212F, or 100C, so if the device measures 212F, the true temperature is somewhere between 208.4F to 215.6F

This implies that the accuracy of the device gets worse as the temperature increases?

OK for ball park measurements, but if your food needs to be at 180F, you need to measure at 184F to be sure, because of device accuracy.",2.0,negative
I usually like Biore products but was not the case here. I really didn't like the tingling effect (which is not even mentioned on the package and I wouldn't buy it if it was advertised) when i was washing my face. It almost felt like a burning sensation. It also didn't foam enough for my liking. And it definitely doesn't work with a spin face brush. It irritated my skin and made it very blotchy => returned.,2.0,negative

"I'm not a big cracker eater, perhaps because it's too tempting to eat the entire box at once. However, from time to time I buy some crackers. And when I do my first choice is Wheat Thins. They've been on the market for such a long time. I remember eating them at least 40 years ago. (I also remember that shortly after they came out Sandy Duncan was a spokesperson for them. She extolled the virtues of Wheat Thins while standing in the middle of a wheat field.) Today they have the same great flavor they had back then. They have a rich and slightly sweet wholewheat flavor, and remind me a bit of a honey wholewheat bread that I've made on occasion. With just a tad of saltiness, they're not overly high in sodium. All in all, they're a great tasting cracker.",5.0,positive

I had a prestige scope in the past that I loved! Quality control must not be the same anymore. Maybe I'll use this one for spare parts.
Update: Although I am still unhappy with the product, customer service was excellent. Because it was defective out of the box, I was offered my choice of refund or replacement.",1.0,negative

"I've kept a bottle of Tabasco (the original blend) in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit. I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to ""kick up"" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.

I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.

After purchasing and taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old versus new notes  ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested.

Tabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.

I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm very certain you will be pleasantly surprised.

1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar with a hint of sugar and garlic. Available in most supermarkets. Praised in many reviews and rightly so. Look for a large bottle with a rooster on the label.

2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers and available in most supermarkets. Look for the wooden top.

3) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting) featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar - widely available

I hope I've encouraged you to try a few other hot sauces.

PS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost hard to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a ""plus"" in my view but rather a ""minus"" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!

What more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce.

UPDATE (August 2013): While my review was written over a year before - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED HOT SAUCES.

 What sauce came in very LAST?
 Tabasco!

 What was first?
 Huy Fong Sriracha.

"Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: ""You can work with me!""  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.",1.0,negative

"I like the concept of these containers, but the reality is that they aren't of high enough quality that I would move away from using my glass containers with locking lids.  Unfortunately, the ""locking"" of the lids on these Reynolds containers is very slight.  There is no way you would want to put one of these in a bag with other things and run to work as I could easily see the lid coming off and your food ending up all over whatever else is in your bag.  The container itself is, as one would expect with a disposable item, fairly insubstantial.  Think of a ""to go"" container at a deli or restaurant that doesn't use plastic containers.  My main beef with these, though, is that the lids cannot be microwaved, a fact I didn't notice when ordering the product.  I understand that some people don't want to microwave plastic, even plastic that's supposedly safe to microwave, but for most foods having a cover while cooking in a microwave is a must unless you want to have to clean the microwave after every use.  I don't understand why Reynolds couldn't have made the lid such that it could have withstood microwaving a single time.

Really, the only use for these I see is giving some food to someone so that you don't have to worry about getting your container back.",2.0,negative

"I have purhased 4 or 5 different types of Loctite epoxy glue from 2 or 3 different retailers. I always mix the epoxy exactly as directed and I apply it exactly as directed. Yet, NONE of the Loctite epoxys have worked very well. They are not as strong as epoxys I used in my younger days. Recently I bought a Loctite epoxy that was designed to be used with plastic. The glue never hardened... even after 24 hours!  It remained a gooey mess. The process of cleaning up the soft glue created a huge mess because it stuck to everything it touched. You are probably wondering why I bought 4 or 5 bottles of this stuff before I finally learned my lesson.  Well, the stores in my area carry the Loctite brand and they don't carry much else.  So, I kept buying Loctite in hopes that I would get good results. It never happened. I will never again waste my money on Loctite epoxy.",1.0,negative

Possibly could get used to it as I did when I consumed diet drinks, but have totally stopped drinking as much because of horrific weight gain. Why not leave some sugar out, don't replace it with a sweetener.

"For me it is dairy especially ice cream. I didn't really give it much thought today when I went out to a group luncheon with the girls and we all had ice cream. Yuck, in about 20 minutes I felt like I was heading toward a gastronomical freefall into the rings of hell. Fortunately I put two of these pills into my purse after I received them from Vine. I scarfed them down as instructed and eventually after about 10 minutes I started feeling better. Since my relationship with ice cream and its side effects can vary and I ate a small amount of ice cream, the first signs of the tempest in my tummy was over pretty fast and I never needed to take a subsequent pill.
I usually head for Pepto when this happens, but this is actually a good product and I reiterate that it worked quickly. Glad I had these in my purse and took them soon enough to test this product to verify that they do work well if taken at the first sign of distress. I can't say how well they would have worked had I waited too long to take them, but quick action and the pills delivered quick relief.",4.0,positive

"To my surprise, the package of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Star-Active-Dry-Yeast-2-Pound-Pouch/dp/B005KR0MZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Star Active Dry Yeast, 2 Pound Pouch</a>&nbsp;I just purchased at Costco for around four and a half dollars (the price has gone up lately) was made in Mexico.  Regardless, the yeast is just as good as the last pouch I purchased, so I am not complaining.  By keeping the yeast in a vacuum sealed bag in the freezer, I keep a 4 ounce brown glass jar that had contained yeast filled with this in the refrigerator and allow what I need to reach room temperature prior to baking.  If I know I'll be using for several baking sessions, I'll leave the small jar on the counter top.  Keep the yeast dry and cool to maintain the lively yeast.  If I am ever concerned about yeast that doesn't appear to be active, I proof it.  If it is still active, I then take into account the amount of yeast, water and sugar, using the proofed mixture in my recipe.

I've purchased bread machine yeast in the past but find that by adding a little piece of ascorbic acid powder which I've ground from a tablet in a small ceramic mortar and pestle to this yeast, I can achieve the same results.  (I also often use all purpose flour with a little added vital wheat gluten instead of bread flour with great results.)  The Red Star yeast works wonderfully provided it's active, fresh, and is used in the correct environment.  If you are a beginning baker using yeast and you have been purchasing the small packets at the grocery store, this is a smart way to go. Even if you only use half of the yeast in the next two years which is about the truly active lifespan of the yeast after opening a fresh pouch, you have come out ahead.  Just keep it dry, cool and if you can, vacuum sealed for protection.",5.0,positive

"I've bought this Organic Apple Cider Vinegar before, and I've also seen it in stores.  Never have I seen it (or any other organic ACV) priced anywhere near what it costs here.  The fault is my own for not paying closer attention to the size of the bottles, but I do think there is a bit of deception--or at the very least, price gouging--in this being sold for the same price that two 32 oz. bottles (twice as much!) would normally sell for.  The vinegar itself is very good, and I don't mean for my review to reflect otherwise; however, most people buying this product already know how great it is.  Those who already use the product might easily assume (as I did) that the bottles are the 32 oz., because the price is in line with that, and those who have not bought this product before should be warned that this product can be gotten for half the price.  Two 16 oz. bottles for $16.49 is the same price as I'd normally pay for two 32 oz. bottles!  Please take note of this if you are considering purchasing this item.",2.0,negative

"I have been using HATCHBOX exclusively ever since I got a 3D printer but lately I have been encountering an issue on several of their filament spools. After about half of the spool has been used, there is sometimes a point where the leading filament is looped under the rest of the spool creating a tangle. This has caused failed prints because the filament is no longer feeding through the extruder. This is especially frustrating when I set up a print before I head into work and come home to find the print head moving around in the air because it stopped feeding quite some time ago. This has also created jams in the extruder and it wastes my time having to clear a jam.

However, when it doesn't have this problem, I am real happy with the results. I have given away prints as gifts and made things which I use day to day.

(Video Size and Quality was reduced to meet Amazons limits, Watch the full video on my YouTube GadgetClass channel)

The Neiko seems to get decent reviews, probably mainly because it is the cheapest one and soo many more people have bought it, but compared to all of the other calipers in the roundup it actually scored low across the entire data set. The build quality and accuracy is not all that great compared to the iGaging EZCAL. There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which renders all internal measurements inaccurate.

Summary:
Spend $10 more and get the iGaging EZCal which was the best digital caliper in the $30 and under group.

Cons:
~ There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which makes all internal measurements inaccurate. Watch my Youtube video showing this gap visually.
~ While the average accuracy across the entire data set put it within it's rated accuracy of .0015"", it is NOT accurate when measuring at the end of the jaws, where it is off by as much as .003"" (way out of spec)
~ There is a lot of ""Slop"" between the ruling body and measuring body of the caliper which is a big reason it does not meet spec.
~ Finish and build quality are lacking when compared side be side to the iGaging EZCal

Pros:
~ It is cheap?
~ Some have had success hacking a data output cable onto these

"Second time I've bought this stuff.  Does a good job and there's twice the quantity of other epoxy putties  I use it for all kinds of different things.  Makes good hole filler, sticks very well, dries hard as can be but remains sandable.

However it just dropped from 5 stars to two when it jumped within one month from $5.83 to $14+ tax.  That's more than a 200% price hike and difficult to justify.

You would be much better off eating a small piece of salmon (or some other food high in Omega 3s) so you could get not only more Omega 3s but also protein.

Reasons:

It holds 100g of silica gel

It has a heating unit that dries it out by plugging it into the wall vs baking in an oven for hours

It has a hanger attachment

The window is easy to see the color of the silica - This unit I could barely see through the dark window to see the color

"My wife never has high blood pressure and this says she does.
It is over 15 mmHg off on readings and that is a serious issue.  I went to my Dr to have it checked and verified this device is not accurate for reading blood pressure.

I have tried contacting customer service about a possible faulty measuring 'Sphygmomanometer' and to get a replacement.  They never contacted me back and that has been over a week now.

"This is NOT a 72MHz bandwidth scope. It is rated at 72Msps or 72 mega samples per second. Seeed Studios, the original designers, themselves apologized for mistakenly calling it 72MHz bandwidth, but even now still won't commit to the actual bandwidth. In addition, if this is hardwave version 2.72 (the latest version), then many of the 3rd party firmwares don't work correctly with it, at this time.

I gave this only 1 star because it is NOT a ""72MHz analog bandwidth"" scope. As a 4.4MHz scope, I would give it 4 stars. I'd leave off the last star because of the rotten documentation, nonstandard connectors, crappy sine wave on the built-in function generator, and difficulty in figuring out how to update the firmware.

An analog signal like a sine wave requires -at- -least- 8 samples per cycle, which puts this at about 4.5MHz with all four channels going.

This is born out by the antialiasing filters on U17 and U18 on the two analog channels which have a -3dB cutoff of about 4.4MHz. That goes for -everyone's- DSO203.

- Update - A reviewer at Electronic Design News Magazine measured a DSO Quad at only about a 3MHz bandwidth. I would also like to point out that I observed the bandwidth changing when the sensitivity is changed, causing the appearance of a wave near the bandwidth limit to change shape, sometimes drastically.

[...]

It is important to know that channels 3 and 4 are digital only. I think they accept CMOS 5V logic levels. In addition, the wrong TVS protection diodes sourced for the two digital channels, limiting the bandwidth on them to about 1MHz max. For reasonable accuracy on a digital signal, that means they are only useful to about 100kHz. This is only on channels 3 and 4.

The documentation is on SainSmart's website and is pretty good. You'll need an unpacker that supports RAR files.

As a really small ~4MHz portable oscilloscope, this is not completely horrible. It has a built-in signal generator (10Hz to 8MHz) and it can fit in your laptop bag or in a briefcase. This is an open source design, so there are a lot of custom updates to the firmware out there. The internal function generator is used to adjust x10 probe compensation, the capacitors are under the battery. You'll need a stable adjustable voltage reference source with a decent DMM to do the ""self"" calibration, up to 60V.

Unfortunately, the signal generator is really only useful for the roughest of purposes. The square wave is fine if you need it for 3.3V circuits, as it is only 3V. The sine, sawtooth, and triangle waves are horrible. They have 15 very visible, large steps, clearly only 4 bits of information. In addition, there is no level control.

This uses something called an MCX connector. It is a small push-in connector that relies on the springiness of the metal to hold it in place. A bad thing for something like a scope probe that is going to get moved around a lot. I had problems with intermittent connections. Wouldn't it have been better to use a more readily available, more reliable connector like an SMA? Small enough not to increase the size of the scope, but it screws on so it is nice and secure.

For $100 more, you can get a Hantek DSO5072P and have true 70MHz bandwidth with 1Gsps and easier to find BNC probes. It is quite a bit larger which means a nice 7"" screen, but not so portable.

I don't trust SainSmart to know proper ESD procedures, due to past experiences and emailed conversations. So if they are buying this ready-made and slapping their name on it, probably not a problem, but if they actually build it, good luck.",1.0,negative

However, these chips are sometimes a hit or miss; I like my chips with a good amount of seasoning and the right amount of crunch. At times, I have had bags where there would be little to uneven seasoning on chips, with most of the chips being extremely hard to bite into. Despite the inconsistency, I still think the Kettle Brand has the best Jalapeno chips out of some other generic brands I have tried.
Regarding Amazon's shipping/ delivery, everything arrived smoothly and the expiration date was far from when I received it.",4.0,positive

"I ordered two of these, with the idea to compare temperatures inside my camping van to the temperatures outside, to track the progress of my insulation project. However, prior to setting them up, I set them onto the table next to me at my desk, and they've been there for at least half an hour. One of the units reads that the current temperature is 78F and the other says 83F. Their humidity readings are at 37% and 34%.

Granted, one of the units was shipped to me in a very battered box and had clearly been used before, so that may be a factor. The one that was in the battered box and used, the two halves of the device fit together nice and snugly, however the one that was new, the clip that holds the two halves together, lets them flop around a bit -- when the protective cap over the display is on, it takes up the slack, and there's no more wiggling.

The product seems like it could be nice, maybe I just got one (or two?) bad units?",1.0,negative
"Overall, I love the squeeze bottle of condiments over a jar requiring the use of a knife or spoon.  It's the most convenient way to add some jelly to your toast or a peanut butter sandwich.  The only reason I can't give it a full 5 stars is because the family doesn't believe it is quite as tasty as the ""other well known"" grape jelly.  I prefer several other flavors of jelly over grape, regardless of brand, so I am not the best judge how accurate that opinion is, but I do not regret the purchase because it helped me get free shipping on my Prime Pantry order and they are eating it.  I suppose that may be due to the fact it is the only grape jelly in the fridge.",4.0,positive

"I had really high hopes that this could serve as a replacement for my Flashforge Creator Pro Heat Pads. The FF Creator Pro Pads work great but seem to only be available through their site and at the hefty price of $12 a sheet. I figured this got good reviews and comes up in many forums. It should be noted that I'm a pretty experienced printer with realistic expectations. Unfortunately, BuildTak failed most of them. I was optimistic as I looked over the sheets, they come three a pack and the surface looked promising. I peeled off one of the backs to apply and soon realized that the glue didn't seem to be very strong, and only barely adhered to a clean bed. I releveled and began a pretty straight forward print. Good news is that the print stuck to the bed, the bed news was that when it was done, the print wouldn't release. When it did, it took a large chunk of tape with it and since the rest didn't connect to the bed anyway, the first sheet was gone. Round Two: Rinse and repeat with a new print, now the entire sheet came off along with the print. Round three: More of the same, luckily only a small piece came off and I was able to patch it with some painter's tape for now, but I do not recommended these if you are more than the occasional printer. You get one print a sheet. By way of contrast, the Flashforge Pads, are much thicker, adhere very well to the bed, and last about 20 prints each. Guess I'm spending $12 again.",2.0,negative

It is a deception in my opinion.

While this does not have Fluoride, it does have other toxic ingredients such as SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate). It is a foaming agent but many are allergic to it. My young daughter had to go to hospital for treatment when she used shampoos and soaps with SLS few years ago. Now, I try my best to eliminate SLS but somehow Tom's of Maine managed to be present in our home (my fault for not reading the small fonts) largely due to the success of their deceptive packaging that eludes healthiness, while clearly not so.",1.0,negative

I hate this bag.  It is very difficult to fill you have to hold it open while balancing a container to fill from.  It is awkward to hang.

"Don't use it all that much, less than an hour cumulatively over couple of years but it already went through 4 sets of batteries! I always turn it off right after the measurement but I guess it drains the battery even when its off. Now the mode switch doesn't work anymore as it stays in the mm reading and won't change to inch modes. When it was working its was great and I like it a lot, better than my analog vernier caliper, and more accurate than what I needed for woodworking. If the mm mode goes out it will go to the junk pile.

Nice heavy feel and precise. The battery is easy to change, just remove one screw and pop the battery cover - there was no instruction for this, had to disassemble the entire cover to found out the single screw for the battery cover. As for the electronics, it looks like a pretty decent unit except for the battery drainage and the bad mode push button.

"We had ordered these while I was visiting my brother, they worked fairly well and I liked them so I ordered a set for myself. What I received was NOT the same as my brother received. He received three inch wide heavy duty straps, while the set I was sent was  about one and a half inch wide straps and NOWHERE as sturdy as the set he was sent. I immediately returned them and noticed that REPLACMENT was NOT an option. I also noted that there are several sellers for this item that also qualify for Prime. The pricing is very close, so who knows who is selling what ??????? My  Prime purchase was from a seller named Beautiful Time.

7/31 UPDATE - I re-ordered these with Amazon as the seller, they won't be delivered until end of August despite being a Prime item, but I am not in any hurry. I plan on keeping them in the car in case I may need them. For home use I have the original Shoulder Dolly. I will update again after I receive this new order.

08/09/13 - UPDATE - I was notified that the second order for these were actually going to be shipped much sooner than anticipated. I just opened the box from my second order of these straps, and this time the seller was supposedly Amazon. I received the cheaper ones again. These straps are only 1.5 inches wide, not the 3 inch wide ones we first received. Amazon needs to update their description of these straps, or otherwise get the correct ones in stock.

"I'm disappointed. There's not even a hint of lavender scent. If you're looking for a nice smelling lavender soap, you won't find it with this.  In fact, the smell isn't even remotely pleasant. It's kind of stinky....not pleasant at all.

I've used many different brands of soaps, and this ranks at the bottom, in my opinion. I'm especially surprised how much it irritates my hands. So badly that I actually had to use cortisone cream on them. I know my skin is sensitive and often dry in the cold, winter months. That's why I like using natural soaps, especially this time of year. Yes, it cleans and suds up nicely. I don't like how much it irritates my hands, though.

It arrived nicely packaged in a plastic bag, just in case it leaked, so it wouldn't make a mess on the other products in the box. I'm disappointed and obviously sensitive to one of the ingredients, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad product. It's not good for me.

"I am new to Hatchbox ABS filaments. One thing that I have found is the silver consistently clogs the extruder nozzle while printing. It would print just fine for a few minutes and then it clogs and thus cannot extrude anymore thereby ruining the print. A lot of reviews have said that this filament is particularly brittle when compared to the others. I've had it break when unwinding  some to load into the extruder head. This brittleness seems to compound the problem with the filament extruding properly so it doesn't clog. Unfortunately I learned about this after the return date had passed  so I have a roll that is only missing about 3 feet that is worthless.

"I have reviewed hatchbox before as 5 stars as it is perfect, but until now I have only ordered black and white.  The problem with the orange is that it is spooled onto a different spool than their other filaments.

This different spool is approx 2.25 inches in diameter whereas the black and white spools have a diameter of 3 inches.  This would probably be ok on their black or white filaments as they are more flexible, but the orange is not.  Even right out of the sealed bag with desiccant I noticed that the filament was very brittle.

I printed 3 orange rings for bb8 but the last 10% of the spool is unusable due to being tightly wound and breaking.  I have one more spool of orange for the rest of my orange rings, after that i will no longer order colors from hatchbox, only black and white.  If hatchbox starts using these spools on all of their filament I will stop using them altogether.

My experience: I have printed at least 30 rolls of hatchbox filament.",1.0,negative

"I have been using HATCHBOX exclusively ever since I got a 3D printer but lately I have been encountering an issue on several of their filament spools. After about half of the spool has been used, there is sometimes a point where the leading filament is looped under the rest of the spool creating a tangle. This has caused failed prints because the filament is no longer feeding through the extruder. This is especially frustrating when I set up a print before I head into work and come home to find the print head moving around in the air because it stopped feeding quite some time ago. This has also created jams in the extruder and it wastes my time having to clear a jam.

However, when it doesn't have this problem, I am real happy with the results. I have given away prints as gifts and made things which I use day to day.

"I bought this brand of toothpaste in the Fennel flavor because I do not like to use mint, which counteracts the effects of homeopathic remedies. I had assumed, based on past reputation, that Tom's toothpaste contained only safe, healthy ingredients. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I am very sorry I did not look up the current ingredients before purchasing this product, because there are some questionable ingredients, in particular, carrageenan and sodium lauryl sulfate. I have listed all the ingredients below, and included descriptions of the objectionable ones.

I will not be purchasing this brand again.

Calcium carbonate, water, glycerin, sodium bicarbonate, xylitol, carrageenan, natural flavors, sodium lauryl sulfate, stevia rebaudiana extract (stevia), commiphora myrrha resin extract (myrrh) and propolis cera (from bees).

Carrageenan: This is a common food additive which is extracted from a seaweed commonly known as Irish moss. Carrageenan is used as a thickener and emulsifier to improve the texture of processed foods. For some time now, research has indicated it produces&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/inflammation/dp/B000P0JGLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">inflammation</a>&nbsp;in the body, which is considered to cause or contribute to every known disease.

Natural Flavor: The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.

Sodium Lauryl Sulfate: Thousands of studies have indicated the toxicity of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). It is a detergent, surfactant, and emulsifier found in cosmetics, toiletries and household and industrial cleansers. This chemical is linked to nitrosamines, which are dangerous carcinogens that increase the body's tendency to absorb nitrates, which are also known carcinogens.",2.0,negative
Pure Protein has a decent flavor. I like to get extra protein and like shakes but I do think most of them have a funny flavor. 35 grams is a lot of protein and it is very low carbs so that is great.

"I wanted to give this product a higher rating for a couple of reasons.  One, it is very easy to use and has good build quality, and two, because of reason #1 I was hoping that all of the other one-star reviewers had somehow missed something and that this scanner really does detect the hidden items that it claims it will detect.

The scanner comes in a nice box.  The battery pack is easy to connect and even with the battery it is lightweight, yet seems sturdy. The instructions are easy to understand, and it's also an easy scanner to operate and comprehend what the display is indicating is behind the wall.

Unfortunately, the findings can't be trusted.  It's really easy to run the scanner across the wall then drag it back to see what it says is behind the wall, but often when repeating a scan of the same area it does not detect the same items.  It is inconsistent.  Also, it detects items that are not there, as well as fails to detect items that are there.

Because you need to find out what is behind a wall, a product such as this has to be accurate and trustworthy. Based on the inconsistent results I obtained, I can't trust the scanner to reliably tell me what materials are behind that wall, and within a close enough tolerance for accurate location. Without being able to do this, the scanner is pretty much useless.  I was hoping it would work because it is so easy to use.  However, I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers and give it a low rating.  It's not practical to use this scanner because its reliability is suspect.

It's like a politician - it tells you all kinds of stuff but you can't believe it. At least the scanner doesn't have any selfish or ulterior motive like a politician does, though.",1.0,negative

"Well, it worked initially.  I calibrated it and stored it as stated and was able to use it a couple of times.  Waterproof it proved not to be.  During storage the storage solution leaked out and got on other items.  Granted, there is no rubber seal around that part, but in addition to simply leaking out the fluid apparently seeped into the internals of the unit itself.  After about 6 months the unit started acting intermittent and shortly after that it failed to turn on (it came on by itself at one point while I had it outside with me).  I replaced the batteries and it came on, acted intermittent, provided incorrect displays and then shut down; never to come on again.  I recheck the battery seating and found they were all slightly wet.  While attempting to clean out the dampness in the battery chamber one of the terminals (+) came out of the unit and I could see it had corroded off completely.  I even resoldered the contact back on carefully and cleaned the circuit board but still no power.  Into the trash it goes now and I won't be buying another of these units.",1.0,negative

"I was excited when I saw the commercial for Krave.  Being a genetic chocoholic (my entire family as far back as we know) I knew I'd try it as soon as it hit the shelves in spite of not being truly satisfied with *any* chocolate flavored cereal - ever - even as a kid.

I purchased a box of each variety and tried the ""plain"" one first. Of course the first thing I had to do was bite one in half to see the chocolate center.  I had to really look to see the very small, thin strip of chocolate on one side of the inside of the hollow pillow.  Nothing like the box photo which seems to show a full chocolate center (could that be considered false advertising?).  I ate a few dry.  They were ""just OK"".  The outer shell is somewhat bland but the chocolate seemed to come through a bit, however nothing as strong or full as I'd expected.  Considering the size of the strip I wasn't totally surprised at this result.  So out comes the milk for a bowl full.  It works OK with milk but has a very odd mouth feel.  Somewhat grainy but the chocolate stood out more and presented a more chocolate flavor than when eaten dry.  It's not a *great* chocolate, tasting much like a chocolate syrup mixed with a chocolate spread, but acceptable for a breakfast cereal having a bit more chocolate flavor than most.  Then the side effects hit.  The chocolate didn't really melt as much as it combined with the shell turning into a paste that stuck to my teeth much like a gummy snack.  Bummer.  Then, after only a few spoonfuls, the shell began to get soggy.  The mouth feel was a bit better when soggy (not as grainy) but the gummy effect seemed to intensify.  I was very disappointed with the cereal and couldn't wait for the box to empty so I could move on to something better.  The sad part is I still have a box of the chocolate outer shell variety that I just can't bring myself to open.

I *did* cut the product coupon off the box just in case the chocolate outer shell version is better than the ""plain"" version.  I have a strong feeling that coupon will expire.",2.0,negative
"Gel like in consistency, when the container is opened the material dries out within a few days. I do live in an area with low humidity but other brands lasted longer. And, although I do not want anything too heavily scented, this product is too lightly fragranced although I do like this particular variety which has a clean, rather than perfume scent. It seemed like a good addition to my prime pantry box.

The lid twists open but refuses to stay in place, it slips back down to the base. So to prop it open I cut a wooden kitchen skewer into a short length and poked it into the gel extending out a 1/4 inch or so which prevents the lid from closing. This is a problem I never encountered with any other solid air freshener. So, between the short-life of the gel, weak fragrance and the inability of the container to stay open, I am not impressed.",2.0,negative

"Compared to modern home AV systems, my flat panel TV/audio system is fairly primitive...an old NAD stereo receiver connected to two fairly decent speakers.  That worked fine until I bought a new TV and forgot to check that it included right and left channel audio output jacks...it didn't.  Hooking the audio output from my cable box to the stereo was a poor solution; there was significant delay between the cable box output and the picture on the screen.  Everything was out of sync by at least a quarter of a second.

This Decoder provided the solution.  Connecting to the TV's optical audio output, I was able to hook up to my old amp through the decoder and was shortly back in business.  It couldn't have been easier.  By using the TV's output, the delay between the audio and video was eliminated.  Even better, everything I now show on the TV, regardless of the input source, has the associated audio fed out through the optical connector.

A couple of reviews have commented on the reliability (or lack thereof!) of this product.  My unit does run a bit warm on the outside.  Since it's a plastic housing, which doesn't conduct the heat well, it's liable to be pretty hot on the inside.  I suspect that's the source of some of the reliability problems.  Only time will tell.

Highly recommended...at least so far...

Update - 4/22/11 - My unit did fail.  The company quickly replaced it under the warranty.  From the comments on the paperwork, it looks like there have been some engineering changes since my original unit was manufactured.  Hopefully that permanently fixes the problem.  As long as you order from a vendor that turns over its inventory, anything that you order today should incorporate the update.

Update - 6/2/11 - It died again.  Sigh.  I give up and am going to buy an A/V receiver with built-in optical inputs.  Changing this review from five down to two stars.",2.0,negative

"I bought one of these at Costco and quickly returned it after realizing BS the specs were. The 6.0HP spec is pure baloney. Here comes my engineering take on it: One Horsepower equals 746 watts. Your typical 15A circuit breaker on a 120V line can output a max of 1800 Watts (120V*15A) before breaking the circuit. This thing claims 6HP, which would be 4475 Watts of power! That's crazy! You would need a 20A 240V line to power a 6HP motor. That's just science. I get that it claims 6 HP ""peak"", but that's still pure wishful thinking and very misleading advertising.

Given that they couldn't even be honest about the power, let me give you the real specs of it. It uses 11.5A during operation. This means it is really a 1.9HP motor. (120V*11.5A=1380W, 1380W/746(W/HP)=1.849HP). I'm not sure why the feel the need to give blatantly false specs like this, but if that's what they are going to do, I cant trust them to make a safe, reliable product. Who knows where else they were dishonest - the enamel coating on the magnet wire in the motor? The grade of plastic used for the injection molded parts?

"The Hoover MaxExtract77 Multi-Surface Pro Carpet & Hard Floor Cleaner is advertised to clean both carpets and hard floors, including sealed hardwood floors.  In the past we've used a Bissell carpet cleaning machine which has worked well on rugs & carpets, but having been unable to find a good hardwood floor cleaner we have always had to clean our hardwood floors manually.  Since our home has a lot of hardwood flooring with some rugs & carpets my wife and I were very hopeful this model would meet our needs with one machine.

The cleaner arrives packaged in a huge box.  The contents were neatly packed, and nothing arrived broken or missing.  Assembly was simple with only a Phillips head screwdriver needed to attach the handle.  The instructions included with the cleaner are poorly written and illustrated, but we were able to figure out how to use the machine with little difficulty.  The Hoover web site, to their credit, has some very clear-cut videos that show exactly how to assemble and use the cleaner.  I recommend viewing those before trying to operate the cleaner since the printed instructions are so poor.

As advertised, the cleaner has separate tanks for clean and dirty water.  My wife found it difficult to snap the tank with clean water into place, but the dirty water tank is easy to install and remove.  The cleaner comes with sample cleaning solutions for both carpets and hardwood floors (different solution is used for each).  First off, this machine is very loud -- much louder than most vacuums and so loud that hearing protection would be advised during usage.  It is also quite heavy and cumbersome to move around on carpeting.  My wife had a fair amount of difficulty moving it in directions other than straight forward and back.  It cleans rugs and carpeting well, and the suction left no moisture under our rugs.  My wife felt it may have cleaned rugs slightly better than our Bissell unit did, but she found this Hoover cleaner to be much more difficult to push around on rugs.

We were greatly disappointed in the cleaner's ability to clean our hardwood floors.  While it did fine from a cleaning standpoint, the cleaner did a very poor job of extracting liquid off the floor despite using the included squeegee attachment.  It left a large amount of liquid on the flooring and seemed to do little more than push it around the floor when it was supposed to be sucking it back up.  Even worse, it seemed to deposit more liquid on the floor while we were trying to dry it.  It ended up generating extra work as we had to mop the floor afterward.  In the end my wife felt it involved less work to clean our hardwood floors manually than it does with this Hoover cleaner.

Bottom line:  if you have predominantly rugs & carpeting you will probably be happy with this Hoover floor cleaner as it really does clean those areas well.  But you could also probably find another rug & carpet floor cleaner that does just as well for less.  I cannot recommend this floor cleaner for hardwood floors.  We do not have tile floors in our home, so I cannot fairly comment about how it would work on tile surfaces.  But as poorly as this unit performed with extracting liquid off our hardwood flooring I would not expect it to work any better on tile.  So our search goes on for a good hardwood floor cleaner.  This Hoover is not the machine for that job.",2.0,negative

"I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.

As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.

Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.

"I received this on 12/24. Very easy to assemble. Adjusted the suction so the vacuum would be easy to move on the carpeting.
I vacuumed the bedroom and then switched to the wood floors. While I was vacuuming, it gave off the strong odor of ""heat"". I never  was subjected to this with either my  Dyson or my Electrolux Nimble. I purchased this so my wife would have a lighter vacuum to use. I shut off the vacuum and found that the shroud covering the motor section was so hot that I couldn't even touch it with my bare hand. I then went to unplug it and found that the AC cord was exceedingly warm to the touch. All this was first use right out of the box. In my opinion this condition is either poor manufacturing or poor engineering. I have seen other reviews complaining of the vacuum overheating and shutting down. Nowhere does Hoover address these complaints, other than to say, "" check the filters and empty the container and check the roller"".  With me, this was straight out of the box. Needless to say it is being returned forthwith. One thing I don't need is a possible fire or worse. I'll look for something else.",1.0,negative

"I'm all for saving the planet, but I'm also selfish and practical, so I generally use Tupperware and/or the little plastic containers that pre-packaged cold cuts come in. The concept of a biodegradable ""Heat & Eat"" container was intriguing, so I figured I'd give it a try. The size is nice, and each container can hold a generous portion of food. I wasn't thrilled by the loose fit of the lid, but I could live with it. What I couldn't live with was the fact that, after a night in the fridge, my leftover Hamburger Helper had pretty much soaked through the bottom of the container. The container wasn't ruined, the food was OK, and it survived the microwave process, but that really turned me off to the product. If I'm paying for a product that can only be used once, it had better work perfectly that one time. If you're on Extreme Cheapskates, and are trying to reuse this...? That's on you. If I can't even get ONE use out of it...? Sayonara. I haven't attempted to use any of the remaining eight containers.",2.0,negative

The cookie flavor itself was pretty good. I like the soft texture, although there is some grittiness due to the oatmeal and fiber. Not objectionable, however. What I didn't care for was how crumbly they are - they can easily fall apart.

But other than that one issue, a very good ""better for you"" type of oatmeal and chocolate cookie.",4.0,positive

I'd always bang around with the standard-size brushes, giving myself a jolt and a shock. However, the standard 3-pack size is less expensive and covers more surface, I'll go back to the other size.

Update: while removing the compact brush head, it came off in two parts... just swell. Still works, but I will use a screw driver to pry off the brush head next time. Not what I expected for anything this expensive.",2.0,negative

2018, January Update: The price is now 27.87 which is still to high. When you get down to the inside winds of this filament it is wound so tight in a small circle that it wants to break just sitting on the spool.

"The reason I chose this answer was not because of the product in the container, but because in my opinion the container itself is not appropriate for shampoo. Unfortunately the bottle flipped off during shipment and just about destroyed everything that was shipped with it. If this bottle were to fall from the little shelf that I keep my shampoo and conditioners on, there is no doubt in my mind that it would flip open from the fall and pour out on the shower floor (my opinion). The small flip open cap that are usually found on bottles of shampoo including the Loreal Absolute Repair Cellular with Lactic Acid has such a cap, and has been knocked on the floor without spillage. Obviously I was very upset about  your shampoo messing up my shipment by emptying in the box. This was a first, I wouldn't even suggest Loreal put tape on this bottle cap because the top is to big. I'm not sure the liquid would stay in the bottle anyway, because you do not have the choice of standing it on either end, only on the top. It also would be cumbersome to deal with in the shower. Sorry you lost me on this one. I probably will send all three Loreal Products back.",2.0,negative

"This was my first and last experience with Glad Press and Seal Plastic Wrap. I have used many brands including Glad' s plastic wrap.(original). That can be a little bit of a challenge to use at times.

This stuff however, is like using extra wide Duct Tape. It doesn't want to pull away from the rest of the roll. The box fell apart as I was trying to get it started.

When I finally got some off I found while it will stay where you put it okay.  It doesn't want to re-seal onto the item you put it on. Meaning I had to use a whole new piece to cover my food again. Doing so deposits twice the residue from the adhesive. On glass or plastic it's hard to get off worse if it's textured

This lead me to be very frustrated and displeased with the performance of this product.  As I find it costs much more than Glad plastic wrap and does much less in comparison. For this reason I can't recommend this product to others.",1.0,negative

"Yummy yummy! Good value.

Had these with diced strawberries mixed in yesterday. Also yummy with pureed tart apple, fried up with a little butter and cinnamon and then added to the mix. nom nom nom.

Have used this brand before and never had a problem.

Decided the bigger bag was a better value and just poured it in a storage bag inside an empty big coffee container to help protect it and keep it fresh as I don't eat pancakes all that much. As always save the original packaging if you do this. (The reason I mention storage is because it's not good to have pancake mix sitting around in an improperly sealed box or bag for long periods of time. I've had enough bad experiences with mold to feel moved enough to share this here because this is the ""family size"" package that might end up sitting in your cabinet for a few months at least. I've heard horror stories of people getting sick from mold toxin because just enough moisture slowly built up and mold grew, and it wasn't easily noticeable, probably in part because of the consistency of the powdery medium not being a solid surface like you might notice mold on cheese for example. Knowing what I know about mold, it's probably not all that common, but if the box or bag sits around long enough in a moist climate without being COMPLETELY sealed it might just be enough to allow slow growth of just the wrong kind of mold. What makes the nasty mold dangerous is the toxins it releases over time. So just do yourself a favor and invest in a storage container (or use a big Folger's plastic ""can"" with a storage bag, like I did) and keep your floury substances away from moisture and storage in a well-sealed container.)

On a happy note, forget doing these pancakes injustice with fake ""maple"" syrup.  If you are willing to spend more than a dollar on a cup of coffee, why put junk on your pancakes? Go the extra mile with this Vermont gold&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hidden-Springs-Natural-Vermont-Maple-Syrup-Amber-Rich-32-Ounce/dp/B00COBZ6B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hidden Springs Natural Vermont Maple Syrup, Amber Rich, 32 Ounce</a>.

"Despite having several cake recipes that I will only make from scratch, I am a huge Betty Crocker fan for basic white or chocolate cakes.

Beyond those basic instructions, I find their mixes to be very versatile if you choose to substitute liquids such as milk, coffee, or sour cream for the water or desire to add other ingredients.  With the milk chocolate variety, I find that stirring in finely chopped chocolate chips & almonds makes a delightful cake.  The real trick to the best result is to ALWAYS set your timer for 5-10 minutes less than the minimum time for the size you are making.  Test for doneness by appearance (pulling from the sides of the pan) and then touch or toothpick at the center.  You can always cook a little longer if needed but you cannot ""uncook"". More than 40 years of cake baking has taught me that most cakes are already overdone by the time the minimum time stated has elapsed.",5.0,positive

"I bought this because I had seen the company's larger version in use at various events. I didn't need the capacity of the larger version, so I got this one. Profoundly disappointed.

Using Great Northern Popcorn kernels and oil, following the directions exactly, I typically get 59 to 68 un-popped kernels per batch. Remember, this is a VERY small batch. I can put the exact same popcorn kernels and the same oil in an ordinary saucepan on my kitchen stove, with a vented lid, and get 5 to 7 un-popped kernels.
Further, the lid (actually two lids) on the basket hang up near the hinge edge and won't let the popcorn out. I tried making small bends in the corners of the lids to see if that would help. It didn't.

"This product is a great idea on paper but the implementation is totally bad.
Pros :  Inexpensive
  Has great suction when it works.
Cons:  Tips over way too easily.  When it tips over there is no longer any suction and you have to turn it off and then back on to get suction back.
  The tipping over happens so often I just want to throw it away.
  Power cord way too short.
  Hose is way too short.
  Filters are very inadequate.  Motor is already getting covered with dirt and debris after only a month of occasional use.
  Filter Instructions are very unclear and confusing some of the parts seems to be missing to keep the filter on.  I had to use a rubber band.
  The filter should be properly installed by the factory mine certainly wasn't and the instructions seemed to indicate that was normal.

Not only has it no flavor (even if adding salt), but also the cans seem old. (I come from canning family so I know about this.)  The shelf date was only a few months away, too.  So seems someone wanted to get rid of their older stock.  I will say that the cans weren't rusted or dirty. And had only a few tiny dints on the bottom in one.  So they appear safe enough to eat.  But not worth the price.  I wouldn't even want to mix it with other foods to make it palatable.  I'm sorry to be harsh, but truth is truth.  If you've read my other reviews you see I do like a lot of products I buy from Amazon.  Just not this one.  I wish the product were better.  I'm always in quest of no or low salt.  Edit: Amazon is refunding for the 4 unopened cans plus shipping. Which means I had to pay for a can that was inedible.

This has nothing to do with the product but the carrier ONTRAC. Not pleased with their delivery or lack of delivery. The only problem was with ONTRAC delivery. Lazy? Point-of-fact my package with three items was delivered to the wrong address because the carrier was too lazy to walk it to my apartment. Only had trouble with ONTRAC The carrier did  not even attempt to deliver to my address or leave a note on my door and dropped it off at the leasing office. I would have never known about the delivery except I have Amazon mobile phone tracking and they text me. 2 DAY deliverery turned into a week! I had to wait for some one to go to the office within their business hours. I depend on others to carry packages I can not carry such large packages. That is why I expect them to deliver to my door as usual. ONTRAC learn from the more professional big guys like UPS or FedEx.
********
June 2013 The next delivery I received via OnTrac of other items was delivered with a very pleasant delivery person to my door. THANK YOU ONTRAC for listening and respecting your customers simple request.
Update: Oct 16, 2013 OnTrac again no attempt to deliver or left delivery note at door but lazy person delivered items to leasing office.

This is also causing print to be brittle. I have oriented the spool in many different positions (mounted on top of printer, spool on table next to printer, ect) Some parts of a print will look smooth while other parts look bad.

The problem, and reason for the two stars is it smells like old stale hot dogs, or some kind of rancid meat, but with a hint of smoke or something. It's definitely coming from the filter and is the strongest when the tent door is open and it gets the best airflow. My entire apartment now smells of this weird spoiled meatish food smell, and I have to leave the windows open in the middle of winter just to get some fresh air, ironic.

Then you leave the glass on the table, and come back when to it and all the ice is melted and you stir up the liquid with that wee little bit of juice at the bottom of the cup and you drink it. It's like it's mostly the taste of water and that tiny, little speck of flavor from the juice.

I used to buy Chunky soups by the dozen cans, any flavor, esp. Sirloin Burger and the other beef ones -- then one day about six years prior, the 'Sirloin' suddenly tasted like dog food.  Yeah, and that's how this one tastes, too.  Not at all reminiscent of 'cheese' or 'burger'.

How do they get that amazing tea flavor, aside from the heavenly jasmin?
I really was not a daily tea drinker until I discovered this at Whole Foods but this is so much more convenient. No additives, no sugar, no sucrose, no harsh acidic taste. I am thinking of Snapple here which is soo addictive but not in a good way since it has some additives which aren't too great for my body. It has Sorbitol in particular which absolutely sends my intestines into convulsions.

The last cookie was the best, well, at least it was edible and larger.  HOWEVER, though the package for it is labeled ""Oatmeal Chocolate Chip"" it was actually oatmeal and nuts.
Fortunately I am not allergic to nuts but I cannot help but think what might have happened if someone with allergies to nuts was eating one of those on the way to work while driving the car.  ...

"UPDATE3  Went back to cascade and have had no problems since.

UPDATE2 My dishwasher leaked all over the floor. We looked and looked and finally found bits of plastic stuck in the drain at the bottom of the machine and even in the holes in the washer arms. I couldn't figure out where it could have come from. Well today I washed my dishes again with one of these tablets. It didn't dissolve completely. The plastic that was left stuck in the cup looked exactly like what I had found clogging the machine. I'm done with these for sure now even though I hate throwing out this expensive product. It would be much more expensive if it totally clogged the motor.

UPDATE The reason the dishes didn't get clean was because the dishwasher packet didn't dissolve. I dried the dishwasher holder thoroughly. I hope that the whole box off cleaners isn't ruined. I put them in a dry place. I wrote the company and they gave me the ""you're water's probably not hot enough"". Not true. I also used the water heater boost on my dishwasher. I can see the other tablets are appearing to break down. I have them stored in  dry place and I make sure the holder in the dishwasher is perfectly dry and my hands are dry when I touch the tablets. These might work ok someplace where there is no humidity.

I have only used this once, but it works better than the other type of one piece dishwasher detergent. I've used two of the other name brands and I left my dishes dirtier than normal when I used this one and it cleaned better than the others.

UPDATE The  second time I used these I didn't scrape all the food residue from my dishes. The directions said it wasn't necessary. I will probably need to soak and clean the dishes then re-wash them. This didn't work as well as prior products I've used. The first load I washed I had already made sure there was no remaining food. The food this left on seems like it shouldn't have been that hard to get off. Nothing burned on just small amounts of things like spaghetti sauce and peanut butter.",1.0,negative

"I bought this switch to repair an old Grizzly TSC-10L table saw.  Looked really nice, and I read a lot of the reviews before buying it.  Let's just say the reviewers that said this switch is too big for a normal size box are dead on accurate.  It is too big, but there's an even more annoying problem than that.  The contacts inside aren't sealed from dust.  Within a couple of weeks of having it installed, I had to tear it out to clean up the saw dust inside and it ran again for a few more weeks until I failed again.

This time I tore it down completely, opened up the back side to look at the actual switching mechanism.  The neutral line contacts were so badly carbonized due to the dust intrusion that they were no longer making contact.  Cleaning them with some emery paper solved that problem, but after seeing how easily it was for dust to get inside, I decided to just not bother re-installing it.  Instead I picked up a 20A standard toggle switch and cover plate.

Now my saw is working again with a regular size box and the wires aren't crammed in there.  It's a shame really it's a nice LOOKING product, but it's design is flawed in that it isn't protected from dust intrusion, something that should be considered when it's a switch designed for tools that generate lots of dust.

I can't even imagine the problems you might have if this were being using in a metal shop and metal dust and shavings were to get inside this switch.",1.0,negative

"Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: ""You can work with me!""  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM.

"Mainly I think this product is good value.  Also, there is an advantage to getting active dry yeast as opposed to cake yeast.  It has low moisture content, giving it longer shelf life.  The shelf life of active dry yeast is 2 years from the package date, but it's advisable to use it within a year.  If frozen, it can last for over 10 years.  The main disadvantage is that it's more vulnerable to thermal shock than other baking yeasts.

As an alternative to dry active yeast, you might prefer instant yeast.  Unlike active dry yeast, it doesn't require rehydration, plus it is has a much higher percentage of live cells.  Some people swear by it.  If you'd like to get instant yeast, here's a popular one on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fleischmann-s-Instant-Yeast-2-16-oz-bags/dp/B001BZEGN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fleischmann's Instant Yeast - 2/16 oz. bags</a>.

"Smart Start Antioxidants Cereal, Original, 17.5-Ounce (496g) Boxes (Pack of 4), by Kellogg's.
Why Amazon has this cereal listed as ""by Smart Start"", I don't know. It is made by, and distributed by, Kellogg's Sales Company. And now on to the cereal itself. It consists of flakes of combined wheat, rice, and oats. It is crunchy and chewy, and stands up to milk quite well without becoming soggy. It has 100% PDV on many vitamins and minerals, but only a minimal or none PDV for Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, and Vitamin D, so it is not a substitute for a daily vitamin pill with minerals. The sugar content is very high at 14g per serving, about twice what most other cereals contain, and the salt content is above average at 210mg per serving. The plusses are taste, vitamin content, and texture. The minuses are too much sugar and salt. Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt. Sugar is addictive, and it leads unsuspecting children into developing hyperactivity, rotten teeth, and Diabetes. The excessive amount of salt contributes to developing high blood pressure. Overall, I would have to give this good tasting cereal an Amazon rating of four stars.

"My name is William Hardin and I am....a peanut butter fan. There I have said it so I can relax now that the world knows. You will never find me without PB at home. There is always back up jars just waiting on the bench to be put in the game. That being said, because of the cost differences, I typically purchase the best value. In a perfect world my option of choice would be Skippy smooth in small jars. Every 5th jar would be Skippy super chunk. Super Chunk is good but a bit much for me all the time so I use it every so often.

So now the you know I like the product, why only four stars you ask? Because I am not the biggest fan of this size & style of container. The smaller the better so you prevent the PB from separating the oil or getting too loose. Jars with straight sides are easier to empty than this design which basically requires your hand be INSIDE the container to finish it off.",4.0,positive

All that isn't so far out of the realm of normal though for prismatic tape; what really irked me is that it's really not that reflective.

"I like these.  They have a wonderful texture and crunch and just the right balance of fat/oil and saltiness to really bring out the flavor of the seeds.  (And yet, they're still low in fat and sodium!)

These have a strong sesame seed taste and are definitely more of a savory cracker than anything else.  So these would be good with cheese or hummus or natural (non-sweetened) peanut butter, but might conflict with sweeter toppings.

I mostly love the ingredients, although I wish they didn't have potato starch in them.  I think it would be possible to make completely whole grain/seed, non-starchy crackers that were pretty good.  The fats are all healthy plant fats and these are vegan, non-GMO, and certified gluten free.

"I unboxed the device, turned it on, and it seemed to work. I exposed it to a sample of ore which had been measured at 750 cpm of Beta, the seller said. I put that sample on the deice - nothing. I then exposed the device to an air cleaner filter - a low level source. Nothing.
The output of the device fluctuates up and down even if the sensor is blocked with metal or other objects.
This does not seem to sensing anything, and I can't get different readings from concrete walls, carpets, or other items.
In other words, this does not seem to measure anything with any sensitivity.
This might be a bad tube, so I'm sending it back. I had hoped that it would respond, but was disappointed.

"As so often, this product has tons of fake, paid-for 5-star reviews. Many are lazy and say nothing much. You can't write much when you get paid by volume. Some just write ""Five stars"" or ""Yum.""

As for Nutella, I won a free sample at my local Vons grocery store in Santa Monica. I wouldn't have bought it myself.

I expected this ""hazelnut spread"" to be similar to peanut butter.

But it was NOT to be. This is PUDDING! It looks and tastes just like chocolate pudding. Yeah, maybe with a hint of hazelnut. But this is pudding.

This is loaded with calories. 200 calories per serving (along with 23g of carbs, and 21g of sugar, and 12g of fat). My 13 oz jar of Nutella has 10 servings, making for 2,000 calories. This larger 26.5 oz jar would have over 4,000 calories.

As with most JUNK FOOD, a tiny portion contains many calories. Unfortunately, it also tastes great, encouraging overindulgence. People will buy a sack of potato chips or tub of ice cream, and devour it in one sitting. If you eat half of this 26.5 oz jar of Nutella, and spread it on bread, that would be half of your entire recommended daily calorie intake. No wonder Americans are increasingly OBESE.

This is great-tasting JUNK FOOD. Lots of sugar and carbs. So if you're goal is to raise&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/obese-children/dp/B01CZDZKH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">obese children</a>&nbsp;-- who are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/diabetic/dp/B000FCJZIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">diabetic</a>&nbsp;to boot! -- then go ahead and buy this for your family, and stuff yourselves silly.",1.0,negative

"Update: After some extensive use and on my 2nd sheet of this Im changing this from 5star to 2star. Trying to print anything somewhat wide or long in area that also has a 1/2""+ in height will cause this sheet to rip up from the build plate (and your print from the sheet). While you *can* get some permanent 3m adhesive sheeting, that screws up your ability to shim the PEI which is required since none of these sheets are even remotely flat. I estimate variations +/- 1mm will leave you frustrated if any of your prints require precision. Theres no reason they cant make these sheets precise, the tech exists, this is just lazy manufacturing. Im going to look towards solid specialized buildplates since there is no way to have this adhere to the printbed AND be level.

---old----
PEI works great with PETG, no heat necessary at ~75f. Its kinda hard to get up thin sheets but thicker prints you can pull right off. I used this on a robo 3d r1+ with double sided sticky tape as there is no room for clips and adhesive sheets appear to be a more permanent solution.

"Good contact cement for the price. Works best with non-porous materials. It affects rubber causing it to curl. Directions recommend having materials to be bonded at 65 degrees or more for 24 hours before bonding and for another 72 hours after bonding. I found this a pain as i wanted outside air exchange with the air in my shop to minimize the fumes from the cement.

The work pieces really do need to be clamped with uniform pressure to get good adhesion. I used all my clamps to achieve this and ended up cutting boards to size for use when clamping the pieces to be bonded.

Holding power with neoprene and with rubber bonded to aluminum sheet was not impressive. I had to redo all the edges using VHB tape.",2.0,negative

"Ive been buying almond milk for quite some time for various reasons. One of the top reasons is because of its shelf life.

I like that I can keep almond milk in my fridge much, much longer than a carton of regular milk (or skim milk, which is what I used to buy in my pre-almond-milk days). And now that I buy many of my grocery dry goods online, I find my trips to an actual supermarket are way less than they used to be, lessening the opportunities for me to pick up a carton of milk. And THEN I discover this same milk I have been buying doesnt need to be refrigerated if it hasn't been opened! There is literally no taste difference than the cold version of this, and I find it lasts just as long once opened, as well.

"With all of the false readings being reported, you've got to wonder if this thing is either clairvoyantly looking back in time at long gone houses, or else it's actually one of the worst-marketed but most brilliant-designed planning tools ever.

""Wait...wait...now I see - an indoor spa!  Yes, you'll definitely need live wires here.""

Seriously, though.  With all of the reviews from people that have scanned walls that they _know_ what's behind them and gotten bad results, how is anyone supposed to trust this thing?  I've scanned walls that I don't know what's there, and the display is pretty cool - but I don't know if it's right.  My two-star review is based in part on that, but I can say from my own experience that it missed or incorrectly classified a stud in a wall that I know is there (because I installed wall plates on either side of it) every time.  It's 0% for stuff that I know exists, so I'm not going to believe that it's nailing everything else.

So, positive marks for being lightweight and having a nice case, and the display is nice and graphical.  Huge negative marks for accuracy, and a bit of a negative against Dewalt for not putting a screen protector on the unit for shipping - like other people, mine showed up a little scratched from other items in the case.

All of that said, I was torn on what rating to give this, though.  I scanned myself three times, and every time it displayed that I'm a stud.  False readings or not...Five Stars.

Alright, maybe not five stars.  But it was still a good pick-me-up.  :D",2.0,negative

"I totally should have known better.  My recent purchase (prior to this one) of Twizzlers cherry flavor was a huge disappointment.  I prefer the strawberry but that wasn't an option.  Taste seemed off and the texture was definitely different than any Twizzlers I had ever eaten.  They went into the trash.  So, for some idiotic reason I thought these might be a good replacement.  I guess I was in a fruity frame of mind now that summer is here.

These do not have the familiar texture, they are too soft and gummy.  But the worst part comes later.  In the form of a bad stomach ache.  It's not unusual for me to get a stomach ache after eating heavily colored breakfast cereals and I should have realized this would produce the same unpleasant symptoms.  I wasn't thinking about that, I was just thinking about my previous love of Twizzlers and my desire to have a fruity snack on hand for the summer.  Like the previous purchase, these ended up in the trash too.  I am reluctant to buy any more Twizzlers now.",2.0,negative

"I wanted to try these as a slightly healthier alternative to Teddy Grahams.  These are organic and have a few less ingredients.

FLAVOR:
With three flavors of ""bunnies"" you get a medley that is kind of nice.  However, only the chocolate ones have enough flavor to even compare to a Teddy Graham.  The chocolate chip has a very, very mild chocolate flavor, but isn't too bad.  The honey flavor is pretty bland.  Honey Teddy Grahams have more flavor, so I'd choose them over plain honey bunnies.

TEXTURE:
These bunnies get stale very fast.  Seal them up well, or you'll have bad tasting bunnies.  Fresh, they're crispy and crunchy and a great size for on-the-go snacking or sitting at your computer with a cup of coffee and these little cookies.

OVERALL OPINION
I do like the organic factor.  However, they're generally a little more money than their competing Teddies, and I like Teddy flavor better.  It's up to you and your taste buds, but I would at least recommend trying the bunnies.  I buy them when they're on sale for cheaper than Teddies.",4.0,positive

"Barbara's Bakery Cereal, Peanut Butter Puffins, 11 Oz. (312g), by Barbara's Bakery.
This cereal is designed for kids. The cereal's title may not sound appetizing, but it tastes reasonably good, although not great, and it may leave your stomach feeling a bit queasy. Maybe my box was a bit rancid, as after eating a bowl, it started me burping, even though the Best By date was still in the future at: 07 June 2015.
This is a puffed cereal, and the internal plastic bag is difficult to open. I am definitely not a weakling, but I had to use a pair of scissors to cut open the bag. After opening the bag, I noticed the smell of peanut butter, and after trying a piece of it, I decided that it tasted like corn and peanut butter. This cereal stands up to milk quite well without becoming soggy.
I gave this cereal one star due to a strange aftertaste, too much peanut butter, the hard to open bag, my unsettled and burping stomach, and the high amount of salt used in making it. (Too much salt can cause high blood pressure and water retention. Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt.) One bowl was enough. I dumped the remainder of the box into the galvanized metal bird seed barrel that I keep on the side porch for over-filling the bird feeder (the doves need to feed on the ground).
At this point, it was too late to return it to the supermarket for a refund.

"Undersized sheet, warped, wouldn't adhere to print bed. Waste of time & money.

I installed this curled PEI sheet using the recommended 3M 468MP adhesive sheet.  The first time I tried to use it, the bed started to preheat and the PEI warped back off the bed at the front and back edges when the adhesive warmed and the PEI returned to its curled shape.  I removed the bed and use a brayer to roll the PEI into the adhesive and did a test reheating.  It stuck a bit better for a few minutes then rolled off the bed again in the front and back.  It's completely unusable.  I never touched the PEI with my fingers to contaminate it.  I peeled the protective sheet and immediately applied the PEI to the adhesive.  I guess I'll buy Ultem sheets from an industrial supplier that I use, for about the same price and I'm likely to get FLAT sheets of Ultem so I can hopefully avoid this wasted time and effort.  I'll also get actual 12"" sheets instead of these 11.8"" sheets that are so small that my 6""X9"" print bed can only get one sheet out of this supposedly 12""X12"" sheet of PEI.",1.0,negative

"I really didn't appreciate the size of these bars when I read the description, so I'll give you some context to keep you from making the same mistake:

If you take one of these mini snacks and fold it in half, it will be just about the same size as one of those ""Fun Size"" Snickers bars that come in bags for Halloween.

You may also notice these snack bars are also about the same price as one of those bags ($4 - $5 as of this writing), but instead of 30 bite-sized candies you get 6. You may also get an added helping of bitterness and resentment, but your mileage may vary.

I would not recommend these for preventing a sugar crash either because they're designed to burn off carbs slowly.

The texture and appearance are of that of refried black beans. I had to scoop this out of the can with a spoon. While I do enjoy thick soups this was just so thick it didn't seem like soup anymore.

"Sorry - I fully expected I would have a great review for Maxwell House coffee, but this particular batch of K-cups is a disaster.  The first cup I brewed, the K-pot ran really slow, and seemed to struggle to finish brewing the cup.  My next cup that morning was a different coffee, and the pot brewed normally again.  Next day, the Maxwell House pods again brewed very slowly.  The next day, my pot would not brew at all.  Nothing would get it to brew.  Eventually (after finding coffee elsewhere) I did all the cleaning things, especially the upper needle.  I ran plain water (no pod) and got a cup loaded with very fine coffee grounds. I ran this cleaning a few times.  I used other pods for a while, and all was fine in my world.  But in the interest of science, I ran plain water after each cup - no fine grounds. So, now I tried another MH pod - and the problem instantly came back.  After the very slow brew, I ran a plain water through, and again had a cup loaded with fine grounds.  I know the coffee is probably fine, but the pods are defective, and dangerous to my pot - which has been a loyal and dependable machine until now.

"I know it says ""Nano"" right there in the product name, but holy JEEBUS this thing is TINY! It's actually just 3.5"" x 2.5"" x 0.5"" (the dimensions listed in the details are for the product packaging). This thing could get lost in the palm of my hand!

Having said that, it works much better than I expected. I'm using this to tune car audio systems, and it functions flawlessly for that purpose. I did have to get a separate 10x probe (along with a 3.5mm-BNC adapter) to read amplifier output, but those things are dirt cheap and readily available.

The display on this unit is very bright and easily readable, which is especially surprising considering its size. It does lose readability when viewing from an angle, but considering the price, that's forgivable.

Max probed voltage resolution is only 10v, which is why I needed a 10x probe. While most of my audio readings are within the 10v range, measuring amplifier output requires readings as high as 30v in some cases. So the 10x probe allows me to read speaker outputs properly.

I did upgrade to the BenF 3.64 firmware, which removes a couple of annoyances and simplifies the interface nicely. However I found out the hard way that the latest version of these devices requires a special patched version of the BenF firmware. The one linked to in the product Wiki will actually bork your device because it doesn't support the newer display. Search the Seeed Studios forums for the right patched firmware.

Overall I'm happy with this purchase. A little surprised at its size, and I wish it would display voltages beyond 10v, but beyond that it's a very handy tool at a fantastic price. Well done.

UPDATE 06/06/14
===============
I've downgraded my rating from 4 stars to 2. While measuring a circuit using the DSO Nano V3, I noticed that it was telling me a lower-than-expected vrms value. So I checked with my Fluke 88v meter, and sure enough the voltage reading from the DSO Nano V3 was too low (1.95v vs 1.82v). It also kept dropping very slowly.

The battery indicator on the DSO Nano V3 showed 3/4 full, but just out of curiosity, I plugged in the USB cable to charge it. Immediately, the vrms reading jumped up to 1.94v, which almost matched my Fluke 88v.

Mind you, I wasn't reading the DSO Nano's own output signal, this was a completely separate circuit. There's no reason why the voltage it's READING should be affected by its own internal power supply, that's a pretty lame defect.

So in my opinion, this scope isn't terribly useful for precision work. Its only use for me is in checking frequency waves for clipping. For everything else, I consider it useless.",2.0,negative
"St Ives has discontinued a lot of the scents I used to love. I've been trying their new scents, but haven't had much luck. This is too perfumey. I don't smell any coconut at all.

The body wash, as with all St Ives products I've used, does feel great on my skin; I just can't get past the smell on this one and the fact that the scent lingers on my skin all day long. I miss their citrus scent that I had been using for over 10 years, which was suddenly discontinued.",1.0,negative

"Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: ""You can work with me!""  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.",1.0,negative

"We ordered this after reading the recommendation by A. Chalabi (""BEST YELLOW CAKE, A+++ WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH ANYTIME!!!""),

It arrived promptly, although the rest of the experience was a disappointment.

First, the picture is misleading - although we were impressed by the nice metal baking dish and tight fitting lid, the diameter is only about ~4 inches across.  This really was much smaller than we were expecting for the number of guests we were planning to serve.

The next problem was that despite the nice container, the cake inside was dry and rock hard, with a lot of crumbs.

This could have been a major disaster as we live far from town and did not have enough time to get another cake before the relatives arrived.  We managed to take the contents of the tin and with some extra frosting managed to make a passable birthday cake.

It's been a few months but I'm just now getting around to writing this review since we've had some sudden and unusual family health issues.

As soon as I finish this next round of chemotherapy, I'm going to ask Amazon for a refund.

We won't be buying this again!

"In an effort to get my kids (6 and 2) to eat a little healthier, I purchased a few organic items and Earth's Best items from Amazon Pantry. My son and daughter absolutely LOVE these, but in my opinion, they are a little small.

As most moms out there, we are fed some things by our Toddlers.. whether we want to eat them or not LOL. This one of those times.. my daughter shoved a big bite of one of her bars in my mouth. Personally, I found them a little dry and (similar to another reviewer), they also tasted a little ""gummy"" to me.

"I would recommend this kit to anyone who is thinking about buying a 3D printer.  You can purchase a volume upgrade and make this printer print 8.5""x4""x6.5"".  The volume upgrade is being discontinued soon, so make sure you get it ASAP.  It took me 5.5 hours to put it together and 6 more hours to calibrate the printer properly.  There is a support forum what you can use to get answers relatively quick 24-48 hours on average.  4""x4""x4"" printing area limits the size of the things you can print, so volume upgrade is well worth it.  I printed colse to 50 objects with 1/2 pound of included PLA, so I recommend getting more PLA right away.

Changed from 5 stars to one star: my printer power supply failed 10 days after the printer was ordered.  I was able to find a replacement online, because my printer was out of 30 day support window - had to wait for a week to get it, and submitted my request for the first time after two weeks of owning the printer.  Printrbot support is very bad - takes 5-10 days to hear back and my request for a power supply was denied.  I bought a second kit and power supply for that printer failed during the first print.  Printrbot.com support states that you need to return the entire kit to get a replacement power supply.  Interesting piece of technology, but it does not work properly and is not reliable.",1.0,negative

"The price has been beaten to death and is not likely to change. Being a single source critical component of the Xyz Printing Da Vinci is not likely to change. My complaint is that this is the second cartridge I have received that has jammed while printing.
I have purchased 4 cartridges from XYZPrinting so that means I have a 50% failure rate with these cartridges. On the Green one I purchased the cartridge would jam, but with a little forceful tug on the filament I could make it feed again, so not a total loss. However on this cartridge, the filament is jammed tight.
What really burns me up, is that they tend to jam in the middle of a large print job which results in a significant waste of filament so the cost per print becomes much higher than the nearly 200% based on price alone.
Shame on XYZPrinting for first forcing us to  use their cartridges, charging a premium price, and delivering a substandard product.

"This garage door seal is a pain in the neck to install.

First off, the instructions are not detailed enough. It seems like it should be simple, but they don't give any guidance on the recommended offset from the door to make the best seal. On the first attempt at lining it up and putting in the first nail, it seemed too tight so I pulled the nail and backed it off a little. That seemed better at first, but after a few nails, I had gaps in some areas, either at the garage door side or the trim side.

Hammering in the nails above your head wears out your arms a lot faster than one would think, and it's really hard to hammer the nails in straight since the door and/or trim are in the way, especially in the corners. But that's not the worst of it. After I got 3 nails in, I could already tell that there were going to be issues because there were some wrinkles along the nail line where I must have strayed ever-so-slightly off a straight line. Trying to correct it on the next nail was an exercise in futility and only seemed to make it worse.

The instructions say to cut the top strip to the width of the top of the garage door. I did that, and came up 1 inch short, likely because it was stretched along its length during fitting, then was not stretched as much during installation. That corner left a huge unsealed gap and there was no way to fix it without.

After installing the top and part of one side, I decided to just rip it down. I'll have to find something else.

- It's not easy hammering in nails overhead, and I had to take several breaks. Maybe a staple gun would work better, although I'm not sure how well they would stand up to seasonal changes compared to the roofing nails that come with the garage door seal.
- Inadequate instructions
- It's impossible to keep it aligned perfectly straight while nailing, which then causes wrinkles/gaps
- Transferring dimensions directly from the top of the garage door onto the seal caused the measurement to come up short and leave a large gap

Installation tips if you do want to waste your money and time on this:
- Instead of the supplied nails, use screws and washers, or staples
- Cut the top a few inches long prior to installation, then trim it to length when you are working on the last nail/staple
- Have a helper on hand to hold it in place",1.0,negative

"In my opinion, these gloves are terrible. I bought them to work on my car and other light chemical work. These things constantly tear time and time again. When you try and put on a new glove after a tear it is pretty much impossible since these are not powdered and run small. The moisture on your hands keeps the glove from going on smoothly and you have to wait a minute or two for your hands to dry to put on a new glove. Maybe I got a bad batch, I don't know. I was tearing gloves just trying to put them on.

The gloves fit great and have great tactile feedback so that is a plus but I won't be buying these again anytime soon. If you are a home mechanic then I would look at a different glove.

"Original Review:
LED uses less power than incandescent versions. If not tightly closed, it can flicker a bit, so only 4 stars.

Revision:
After very mild field use (Standby as an EMT), the top cap came unglued and popped off. Luckily I found the spring in my pocket and super glued it and the cap back on. It's functional, but the LED in the tip of the unit is not stationary and can move around. Because of that, sometimes it is very dim until moved the LED is moved a mm or so, then it goes back to full brightness again. I like LED vs. Incandescent, but this is a poorly made product and should be avoided.",1.0,negative

"Velvetta is unquestionably delicious, so when I had an Amazon Promo for $ off Prime Panty (I only paid the shipping and handling), you better believe I added these to my box. I wasn't disappointed in terms of quality; the taste, look, cheesiness, etc. were comparable to purchasing Velvetta at my local grocery store. In a word: delicious.

As much as I love Velvetta, its not something I commonly eat and its definitely more of an indulgence. This one little box of cheesy goodness contains 1080 calories (about 3 servings). While its easy for me to have restraint, I know people out there who will eat this entire box in one sitting. Yikes.

Its definitely not healthy, but it is exceptionally delicious So its worth it as an occasional indulgence when the craving for cheese becomes all-encompassing.",5.0,positive

"Just received this yesterday, the Mega 2560 board could not have been QC'ed. The  22-53 connector was soldered in at an angle which prevents the connection of the Ramp board. The only saving point was that I have access to a full hot air rework system and a skilled technician correct the problem. But until I am able to complete the build I will have no idea if any of this stuff will build.
If you are looking to buy this, be prepared to do significant rework on at least the Mega 2560. Most reviews are favorable so my case may be a one off.
The product is too cheap to waste money on a return.

Day three:
Well two of the stepper motor boards are crap. In one case the board could not even turn the stepper motor with no load and before you ask, yes I did the setup described on the WIKI page, and adjusted the current once the stepper stalled.
The other stepper motor board was hooked up to the extruder and would turn as long as I had no filament installed.
Luckily after the what I saw of the Mega 2650 board I bought some backup stepper controllers  so I had one to replace the dud and I have enough to replace the extruder motor if I have time tomorrow.
It's really looking like I didn't save any money by buying this one.",2.0,negative

"Thicker and crispier than your tradition potato chips with great taste. The salt seemed to be baked into the chips rather than sprinkled on which makes every bite satisfying without having a lot of salt rubbing on your fingers.

The one ounce bags are great for children or if you want portion control with your snacking/meals habits. This product is great for kids lunches as it's just the perfect amount without overdoing the calories/fat/salt intake and will teach kids proper portion control.

This is not a good product if you want to snack in bulk as there are cheaper options if you buy larger bags. Each bag comes with around 15-20 chips depending on the sizes

Packaging wise it could use some work. The open-tab opens vertically which doesn't make much sense as you get disoriented from turning it to the side and having the text in the wrong position and may spill on occasion if you are not self aware. The only reason I think it is designed this way is that it discourage you from digging deep into the bag and getting your hands greasy as there is more open space for your hands to reach in. Also upon opening it's hard to re-seal prompting you eat it all in on go.

Overall great tasting product, individual packaging needs a bit of work 4.5/5",5.0,positive

"This isn't a bad tasting wild rice blend but it is certainly nothing special. In fact, its flavoring, is quite subtle. The blend has a lot of salt, MSG, etc and can turn out somewhat watery unless you make adjustments.

What I found most annoying was the relatively long prep time. First, you really need a LARGE skillet WITH a cover. No - you should not use a pot. Rice-A-Roni specifies a large skillet WITH COVER and for good reason. They want you to brown the rice and that takes a skillet. Then the skillet must be covered. That may or may not be the type of cookware you own.

INSTRUCTIONS: First you must get your skillet up to heat and then brown the rice for about 3 minutes using butter or margarine. You can't walk away from this step - it requires constant stirring. Next: add water, the flavor packet and bring it to a full boil. Finally put a cover over your skillet and reduce the heat to a simmer and wait about 20 minutes while you simmer it COVERED.

The result, at this point, was a rather watery mixture that required even more simmering (uncovered) for yet another 4 minutes. The final result was a rather bland wild rice mixture, heavily laden with salt and a bit of the typical burn of MSG.

In the end, this wasn't a terrible blend - rather tasteless but hardly worth the effort.

Using far less effort, I can purchase the equivalent Lipton/Knorr rice mixture - throw it in a pot and I'm done in about 6 minutes.

Please, someone out there make a true natural cola without coffee. Keep the main ingredients but NO sweeteners, no aspartame, no sugar, no fructose.., no coffee, no tea. We can add our own choice of sweetener.

Also tried that new soda making machine. No good! Ingredients loaded with chemicals, sulfites that cause migraines. No option to add my own choice of sweetener; forced to use high fructose corn syrup or aspartame...

"After a month or two, it no longer sticks. I had a simple application, tape some small telephone wires to the inside of a new cabinet.

It has been 1-2 months and the tape is no longer sticking to the cabinet walls. Keep in mind these are very small telephone wires. I have found this to be true a number of times where after 1-3 months, the tape simply no longer sticks to whatever you applied the tape to.

"Overpriced for results.  The ""Attacks even 7 day old stains?""  not sure what it means but I tested that theory out on a white cotton t-shirt I used to wipe up some oil i spilled which changing the oil on my jeep.  OK i didn't expect this to really get the oil out, just wanted to see how much it could get it out.  The shirt washed just fine but as expected the dark oily splotches faded a little but were mostly still there.  Ok so I can be amused by ridiculous advertising sometimes and the nature of 7 day old stains was just bothering me.  So, I waited 3 more days (because I didn't have the patience to wait a full six) and I washed the shirt again and to my surprise, there was no change.  The stains were still there and it hadn't even ben 7 days later.  As a contrasting experiment I used Gain and washed the short again with a bunch of socks and you know what, the darn Gain made a huge difference on the stains beyond the 7 day mark.  Its doubtful in most cases you will use a shirt to wipe up an oil spill but you will spill oily things on your shirt and don't be fooled by this ridiculous notion this Tide is any different than any other laundry detergent is claims to be better than.  The 7 day old stain is a worthless bit of marketing and unfounded.

"Who knew? After reading many of the reviews, it seems this Apple Cider can cure most anything, and is good for whatever ails you.

I have a friend who, on a daily basis, drinks a glass of water, one tablespoon Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar and a squeeze of lemon. She tells me it decreases her need for sugar. If that is indeed true,than I am a convert. I have used this same combination with an addition of ice cubes for three days. Nothing substantial so far, but I shall continue to use this lemon, apple cider, water combination until I can say yea or nay to sugary products. If anyone has a story that they would like to share, I am all ears.

Of note, cider vinegar and lemon can be damaging to tooth enamel. You may want to use a straw to help protect your teeth. Also, this organic apple cider has a pungent aroma, it will wake up your sinuses!

"Uh-oh - saw these peanuts contain cottonseed oil. Hadn't seen that on a list of healthy oils, so thought I'd better research it. Here's what Dr. Weill says when asked if cottonseed oil is okay?

Definitely not. As a matter of fact, in my book, Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, one of the first things I ask readers to do is to go through their pantry shelves and throw out anything made with cottonseed oil. I regard it as unhealthy because it is too high in saturated fat and too low in monounsaturated fat. What's more, cottonseed oil may contain natural toxins and probably has unacceptably high levels of pesticide residues (cotton is not classified as a food crop, and farmers use many agrichemicals when growing it). Be on the lookout for cottonseed oil in packaged foods and avoid products that contain it. Manufacturers like it because it's cheap, and products that say ""may contain one or more of these oils"" and list cottonseed, will almost certainly contain it.

In one oz. of these peanuts is 7g of protein, 22% of your fat, and 170 calories. Probably best to not eat and find healthier nuts without the cottonseed oil.",1.0,negative

"Vulkem brand not sold at local big box store.  I used this to seal around my vinyl window after initial installer's silicone caulk peeled.  I got a fresh tube and the sealant flowed out easily.

I know the label recommended using soapy water to smooth out the sealant but I used WD40 instead and it came out smooth.  Only time will tell if this holds up.

Update (1/2017):  During a rainy spell, window frame started leaking inside at the top of both ends.  Went out to look and this sealant had shrunk and peeled off the window at both ends.  This was caulked no less than a year ago.  I guess I'll go back to using 100% Silicone for windows from now on.

"I rarely give anything one star, but these bottles have been so terrible I find myself having no choice.  These bottles were to be used for oils that I wanted to keep on my dresser top to use at night for rubbing on painful areas of my body.  I have another re-purposed oil dropper bottle that has worked well, but I wanted to make other formulations to have handy.

I have had nothing but problems with these. I have found that they leak constantly.  Even standing on the table top, if I use them, I find my hands full of oil when I put the cap back on.  They are not moved around or anything.  Next time I use them, they somehow get oil everywhere.  It is a mess.

I made the mistake of grabbing a couple to take with me on an overnight.  I thought if I put them in plastic bags and kept them upright during transport, they would at least be okay to take with me on a short overnight.  I sure was WRONG.

When I opened up the bags, despite them being upright the entire time of transport (a matter of a half hour), the bags were LOADED with oil.  I am talking about a teaspoon of oil in each bag.  I don't know HOW they could do this.  It is a mystery to me.  None of the other bottles I had with me did this.  It makes no sense.

I don't know why these bottles leak like this.  I have been using this style of dropper bottle for many years and I have NEVER had anything so awful happen with them ever.  As soon as I can find others, I will replace these.  For now, they are all I have.

I have had a long obsession with white teeth but am a little worried with some of the options available.  Being these Whitestrips claim to be Enamel Safe I thought I would give them a try.  They are as advertised as you will start to see results after a couple days and very noticeable after you go through the twenty strips included without any pain.  They are also very easy to apply and take off though the package says no sticky mess is a bit misleading as it is a little sticky.  The biggest drawback is the taste: image having the envelope glue taste in your mouth but ten times stronger for a half an hour.  It took me about a week before the taste even became tolerable.  But the pain-free results  are worth a little bad taste in my mouth.,4.0,positive

"Oatmeal is good for you. As you know, it's a great source of fiber and lowers cholesterol. Most Americans don't get nearly as much fiber as they should, so incorporating oatmeal into your morning routine has health benefits. My parents, for example, are in their 60's and 70's and they eat a bowl of oatmeal every day at breakfast. For heavy users such as them, this is the most economical way to buy Quaker Oats. At the time of writing, if you use Subscribe & Save, it's less than $7! One box has 91 servings, if you make it according to the suggested portion size. That's a fantastic bargain, especially if you have a large family. A single 42 oz canister costs nearly $5 where I live. This box is 8 lbs of the stuff!

We prefer the Old Fashioned over the Minute version. You are probably very experienced with cooking oats, but in case you are not: The Old Fashioned needs to be brought to a boil on the stove and cooked for several minutes until desired tenderness, but the extra work is worth it because it has better chewiness than the quick oats. I tend to make mine less watery so I can transport it to work and eat it there. That way it stays nice and firm, and the oats will reabsorb some of the water over time and improve texture. It is better to undercook than overcook because undercooking can be fixed later in a microwave. If overcooked, there's not much you can do with the mush. I like my oatmeal cold. It shrinks the oats and gives them a better mouthfeel, but everyone has his/her own preference.

To cut down on calories and sugar, I only use a spoon of strawberry preserve or some other kind of jam. For texture, I add chopped walnuts. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kirkland-Signature-Walnuts-3-Pounds/dp/B000XBCBW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kirkland Signature Walnuts, 3 Pounds</a>&nbsp;are excellent). You can add bananas, berries, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup or any other sweetener. You can also make granola bars or oatmeal cookies with oatmeal, of course.

Note: the pictured canister is not included. This is simply a very large bulk box of oatmeal. Inside are two plain 4 lb plastic bags. I recommend saving your empty canisters to put the oats in, for daily use. The rest, you can put back in the box and store until you need to refill the canister. This will make it easier to handle the oats, versus a big clumsy bag.",5.0,positive
"700 psi?  Repair leaks under pressure?  I used an entire roll trying to seal a pinhole leak on a 4 inch pipe.  This was at only 60 psi.

"Okay, let me start by saying that the H681 is a sound piece of equipment.  The volume is great and the sound quality is pretty good and I've put several hours on the thing without incident (technologically speaking).  The power switch is also easily accessible while wearing this and the volume controls (though they initially felt backwards to me) are easy to access and press simultaneously for call waiting.

However.

The usability for this headset is completely DESTROYED by the fact that there is no way to swivel the piece to point toward (or at least parallel to) your cheek.  So unless it fits you perfectly from go, you are going to have problems.  Not only will you look like a d-bag for wearing one of these things in most contexts, but you will look like a COMPLETE TOOL because the thing wanders away from your face and sticks out away from your head!  It looks totally ridiculous and is even more frustrating when you throw a pair of glasses or sunglasses into the equation.  Look forward to pushing this thing back toward your head every time you want to make a call.

The simple fact is, instead of making a somewhat adjustable piece to go over the ear, they made it out of a solid straw of plastic.  And that, my friends, has compelled me to go buy one that is more adjustable.  It's a terrible waste, considering the quality of the headset otherwise seems very good.",2.0,negative

"OK, not a bad switch, but it does not fit into any commonly available electrical boxes. I am sure there is a special box, deep box, whatever, that only costs, well, more than this switch does. Then if you put it in, THAT BOX, with wires, you will violate the NFPA- NEC standard for percentage of box fill.  I gave up, and cut an opening in a 6""x6"" flat front gray PVC electrical junction box. The extra space made installing the 12 AWG 300Vac wires, a breeze instead of a chore. The switch has a healthy ""snap"" when it operates, so it takes a bit harder push to turn it on than what you normally are used to. This is a ""maintained contact"" full voltage switch, (as opposed to momentary, pilot duty only) so no starter or other control circuit is needed.

By comparison this tape has no grip on the printed parts whatsoever. The parts immediately start warping and lifting off the tape. Too bad because I so wanted it to work, because narrower form factor of the Pro Scenic 714 leaves creases in my 3D printed parts.

I was pleasantly surprised by this purchase and now I will get them through subscribe and save.

June 2 Update: I just tried the loaded baked potato and I cannot tell the difference in taste from the baby reds with roasted garlic and parmasean. I think I like the baby reds better, but since the loaded baked potato came in a single serve cup, this will be good to take to work as a change to what the cafeteria offers.",5.0,positive

"I like cereal as a snack food; it's a fun thing to munch while watching a show on television. Oatmeal Squares are a tasty alternative to the high sugar cereals I often crave.

These highly preserved chemically rich and manipulated instant options are terrible for my health and my family seems to have far less digestion issues since we started making our own baked treats and knowing exactly what we put in our body's for energy is essential to our family health and happiness. If you Read and google ingredients in products like this and decide how much your family and your healths worth with these cheap options like I have ive found it's risking alot to just to decorate a birthday cake. Not everyone can afford organic but go simple and natural. Winco bulk items are cheaper than even these instant classics and you don't need to add 20 chemical softeners, preservatives and plastics to make a nice frosting. Ask your relatives or make it a fun family activity to spend time together mastering the right treats and you'll be better able to live with the right options for your health and your family's.",2.0,negative

Update:

I'm downgrading from my previous 5-star 'I Love It' review to 1-star 'I hate it'.

I originally ordered this in May 2013 and was shipped a product by ""Scientific Equipment of Houston"" (4488 ratings, 99% positive). That funnel was great, nice high walls to hold plenty of liquid, and a flat, smooth bottom for the filter paper to seal against, and smooth, good-quality glaze.

Unfortunately in April 2016, after many successful uses, I broke it (my mistake, not a product flaw, I was interrupted during a hot-filtering procedure and neglected to reheat the funnel before adding hot liquid and the thermal shock cracked the funnel). So I came back to Amazon hoping to get the same item again. I was pleased to see I could just hit the 'buy it again' button without wasting time reading reviews again to find a decent product.

Alas, when the funnel arrived, while it was very well packed, the product itself is low quality. On checking the more closely the vendor has changed, it is now ""Scientific Strategies"" (448 ratings, 96% positive). My fault I suppose for not realizing that clicking 'buy it again' means 'Buy something similar to this again, possibly from a completely different vendor'. WTF Amazon? Changing companies and products on a listing is completely broken, how long was my 5-star review was attached to this POS product misleading other buyers? If I wanted to take a chance on random quality I'd buy from AliExpress.

Anyway, here's why this new funnel sucks.

The sidewalls are quite short, so the funnel must be refilled more often, a problem that is made even worse if you have a layer of media (sand, diatomite, etc) above the filter. Very tedious to use.

Worse, the bottom is slightly dished so that filter paper will not easily lay flat, so if you use filter paper it wrinkles up around the edges and forms channels around and under the edges of the filter. If you are filtering something water-based It is possible to use the funnel if you poke and stretch the filter paper enough to get it to mostly conform to the dish shape, but that is tedious and seems likely to compromise the filter. If you're filtering solvents that don't make the paper floppy this funnel is completely useless.

Don't bother with with this one, it's cheaper than the other options, but you'll just be trading a few dollars for wasted lab time.",1.0,negative

"We've been using Purina Complete and Purina Indoor cat chow for a number of years and our indoor cats have been healthy and active.  They seem to relish it and visit their food bowls at least a few times a day and there have been absolutely no digestive problems.  The ingredient list on Complete lists poultry by-products as the first or major ingredient and that's good considering that other food list grains as the major ingredient, and it does contain all the necessary components to keep the cat healthy - and this includes the critical taurine.

It does contain somewhere around 11% fat and because of this we rotate the chow with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Purina-Cat-Chow-Indoor-Dry-Cat-Food/dp/B001VJ3G50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Purina Cat Chow Indoor Dry Cat Food</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Purina-Cat-Chow-Healthy-Weight/dp/B0085JN2A8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Purina Cat Chow Healthy Weight</a>&nbsp;and make sure that there is always adequate fresh water nearby since they only occasionally get supplemental wet food. I visited the Purina website and could find no information on feeding trials, but judging by the health of our cats they are getting everything they need.

Since the Amazon product page doesn't list the nutritional analysis, so here it is:

"I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the ""big two"" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard ""bad things"" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.

But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.

Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called ""erythritol"" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol ""shouldn't"" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it ""supposedly"" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.

If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the ""bad"" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.",2.0,negative

"The included software (AmCap) would not install on Win 7 using the setup.exe on the disk.  It would just crash the installation software.

I haven't had trouble with the majority of Hatchbox ABS filaments that I've used except for one other specialized version. The silver consistently clogs the extruder nozzle while printing. It would print just fine for a few minutes and then it clogs and thus cannot extrude anymore thereby ruining the print. As some have pointed out this filament is particularly brittle when compared to the others. I've had it break several times when unwinding it some to load into the extruder head. This brittleness seems to compound the problem with the filament extruding properly so it doesn't clog. Unfortunately I learned about this after the return date had passed and so I cannot return the unused filament.,1.0,negative

"If you are the sort of person whose feelings are easily hurt by things in life that make you feel like you are intellectually under-par, don't buy this product.

Just the reviews alone sound like from a parallel universe, where every adult automatically understands why electric motors work -- like brushing their teeth -- and kids and you are the only ones who do not, and must be trained.

I see the same sort of teaching is still alive and well that I had in high school -- I got straight-As in honors Geometry, Algebra 3/Trigonometry, Chemistry, Physics and Math Analysis, but I didn't understand a thing, because the teachers left out the things I needed to know first -- like we do not know why an electromagnetic field forms around an electric current -- it just does.

I'm down with that. I just needed to be informed that I was not the only one who did not know, for no one knows. It's all in a black box called ""Nature."" Physicists can cloak their ignorance by calling it ""a fundamental force of the universe,"" i.e., ""It's just there -- we don't know why.""

Kids who can't get to first base in a subject because the opening statement is missing are told they don't have brains or ""aptitude.""

The instructions for this kit do some serious blathering, I presume about theory, if I could understand them. These instructions make sure to show you the formula for electromagnetic force (see graphic), they tell you that a drawing showing electromagnetism coming is really about electromagnetism going, and that a drawing of electromagnetism going is really electromagnetism coming, and that clockwise is counterclockwise, and counterclockwise is clockwise (see graphic). They show some doodles and say that one of the doodles is a magnet, but it is not labeled, and if it is there, it looks like any other doodle. Magnets can come in any shape or size. No doubt the drawing of this magnet is what an expert would recognize, but I thought this kit was for rank beginners. Draw a horseshoe, if you're not gong to label it. Then take a course in technical drawing or common sense.

So I skipped over to what looked like getting to the point. There were some ambiguous and sketchy instructions for constructing the contraption. Being a dummy, I had to look up several words.

So I ignored the beginning prose, looked up the words, then seemed to have the contraption built that the drawings in the constructions showed, which were not clear.

Then, for a final insult, the entire endeavor crashed and burned into my absolute failure with the following death sentence, the last instruction:

""6. Apply power by attaching 3 to 6 volt DC to the binding post.""

No one said anything about any power. Where is it? Fews ads boast so much about including ""all parts for assembly"" as the ad for this product. All shoppers know the warning ""Batteries not included."" Wouldn't this ad have said that power is not included if it were not? Therefore, I'm still looking among the parts for this legendary power source. Furthermore, if you parse the term ""electric motor,"" it could be understood to read that it creates power to drive an electric motor. How would beginners know that is called ""a generator?"" Where does it say that this whole contraption is not, in fact, the ""3 to 6 volt DC"" itself?

What's a binding post? The instructions won't tell you. I looked it up, and there was nothing like that on my ""finished"" motor.

The outfit that put me through this wringer -- and no doubt I am the only one who ""just does not get it"" -- is called American Educational Products.

In the immortal words of Jack Black (School of Rock), ""Those who can't do, teach. Those who can't teach, teach P.E."" So perhaps the point of this kit is the exercise I got putting it together.",1.0,negative

"This toothpaste makes a lot of claims about what it accomplishes.  However, its only active ingredient is Sodium Fluoride, in just about the same proportion as the other toothpastes I have in the house.  So how is this one any different?  If it really has something special in it that other toothpastes don't have, why aren't they listed in the active ingredients?  In particular, what on earth does all the 3D stuff refer to?

Grit:  Could this be the secret?  This toothpaste has lots of crunchy particles which are much larger than the grit you usually find in most toothpaste.  I suppose they are to mechanically polish your teeth better.  Could this be what the ""3-dimensional whitening action using: patented micro-cleansing whiteners... "" refers to?  What does it even mean to say that a cleanser is ""3-dimensional"" ?  If this is their ""dual silica system"", it is hard to believe that it is enamel safe, because silica is pretty hard (think quartz or sand).

What about the ""Whitebond(tm) protection to prevent new surface stains from forming"" ?  What could this be, since it is not listed as an active ingredient, does it mean it is there but doesn't do anything? Or is it actually there but they're trying to sneak it under FDA approval by not listing it as an active ingredient?

After a few days use, I became afraid to subject my teeth to so much grit polishing.  I am afraid it is going to reduce my enamel, though of course I cannot actually measure this.  But before I have been using an enamel-protective toothpaste, and the weak spot on my tooth started hurting after a few days of using this product.  (Note also the review ""Too Strong for Some"" for other problems).

"I really only wanted the small basket, but since they're only sold as a set I thought maybe I could use the other 2 for something else. When I opened the box to view its contents I was simultaneously amazed and disappointed, amazed at how they work and disappointed at how poorly constructed they are. It's one thing to use thin plastic, but these are so thin that I'm doubtful of their durability. By comparison I have a file hanging plastic box from Rubbermaid that holds about 1000 sheets of paper and I can carry it around without worrying about the paper falling out the bottom. Additionally, although the plastic of these baskets is PP they emit a strange smell that hasn't gone away completely after 2 days of fresh air in my home.

The large basket by virtue of its immense size is not sturdy enough to hold heavy items. The bottom bows out, as does the medium basket, though not as bad. The small basket is the sturdiest of them all, but the poor construction of all the baskets severely limits their usefulness. What I'm most disappointed about is how the individual pieces are connected. The handles have tabs that look like a glob of hardened plastic; they're not uniform in shape, but the holes in the frame itself aren't even round; they look like they were haphazardly burned in with a soldering iron or something that they're too big & the handles thus loose. The same goes for the folding sides, which I noticed because one of the sides just fell out. Upon closer inspection of the tab and the hole I discovered that the holes are malformed. If that's not bad enough, the plastic in several areas look like they were cut by wire cutters so they're not smooth. The edge of some of the side hinges are damaged that they don't properly hook onto the other side at the corners.

Plastic clippings trash and plastic chemical fumes can't be good for the health and environment of the Chinese workers who have to endure this hazardous work so that Americans can enjoy convenience.

"No doubt about it, this is the way to go if you like looking forward to a vitamin that is delicious. I mean some kind of gummy brand anyway. They do taste really good.  Nothing like the vitamins of my youth that were candy like in funny shapes that still tasted...Well, like vitamins. Any adult would enjoy these.  However for me that is where the assets of these things end.  I won't even go into the ingredients and what is there or missing.  To me the high dosage of 6 of them per day is just way too high.  (Making this 180 count bottle only a 30 day supply).  And at over $35 at the time of this writing, its gotta be one of the most costly multivitamins of any kind on Amazon...But that is not the worst of it in my opinion...

By far what aggravates me the most out of these is you can't get them out of the bottle.  These are not gummie bear shaped, but little mounds like the old Dots candy.  With all the smooth edges they stick together something awful.  I mean even banging the bottle briskly on a hard surface loosens just a couple of them off the top.  Personally to get the dosage they recommend you have to bang the bottle hard constantly, (which is increasingly not working at all), or, stick a knife or some other object inside to break them apart. And this is a big bottle.  They are so sticky I am frankly surprised that its barely mentioned among the other reviews here.  I'll be finishing this bottle, but won't be ordering it again.

These paper towels come in comically small rolls, both length-wise and girth-wise.  They also aren't good quality paper towels: they are a lot less effective even in cleaning up the small messes one might reasonably have thought they could tackle.

"I wasn't planning on writing a review of this product, but because of Amazon's insistant email requests, I'll do so, just so I can get on with my life.  This is in no way an attempt to discredit this product or the company supplying it.  It is only my opinion based on my experience using the paste they sent me.

I have used diamond paste for decades, from putting mirrored finishes on hardened tooled edges to bringing scratched, delicate watch crystals back to their original condition.  Diamond paste is the perfect medium for taking fine and not-so-fine scratches out of most any hard material.  I was attracted to TEMO because of the low price.  It's far less than the other supplier I've purchased my DP from in the past.  Especially after volume is considered.  This paste looks exactly like my more expensive brand, has the same consistency, but comes in a 5 gram tube, more than twice the size of that sold by my regular supplier.  Based on those criteria, it truly was a great deal.

To date, I've only found one drawback with TEMO's paste...

It appears to have no diamond in it.

I refer to mine as ""Diamond Paste Placebo"".  If you've never used diamond paste before and use TEMO's paste with a ""wool polisher"" as they recommend, you might be impressed with the results.  What you wouldn't know, is using a wool polisher by itself, will brighten things up... That's why they call them ""Wool Polishers"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meguiar-s-Cut-N-Shine-8-Wool-Buffing-Pad/dp/B0002NYE3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meguiar's Cut N' Shine 8"" Wool Buffing Pad</a>.

At most, this ""diamond paste placebo"" or whatever you want to call it, might lubricate the wool, but will most likely ruin it by clogging it up and causing grit to embed itself into it.  If you're going to use a machine to polish with diamond, such as a Hira-To scissor sharpening device, a thin, metal-backed felt pad would probably be the closest thing to wool that you'd want to use.  I don't own such a machine, so I can't comment on TEMO's success with this type of pad... But I do know, it doesn't work with any other standard backing material, making the odds that it will work on felt, about zero.

With this paste, using it the way diamond paste should be used, properly; I wasn't able to remove the finest scratches on R120 durometer plastic, much less anything harder.  Rouge (on a buffing wheel) does a better job.

From now on I'll buy my diamond from my other supplier<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DMT-DPK-Dia-Paste-Diamond-Compound-Kit-of-1-3-and-6-Micron/dp/B000MF7JSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DMT DPK Dia-Paste Diamond Compound Kit of 1, 3, and 6 Micron</a>, thank you...  1 unpolished star from me...

"Red Star Active Dry Yeast is my favorite of the two familiar retail brands.  If you frequently bake yeast breads and rolls, you know that you use a significant amount of yeast.  A 4 oz. jar of active dry yeast at the local grocer costs between $3.68 and $4.38 or the equivalent of between $14.42 and $17.52 a pound.

I had formerly been able to purchase a 1 lb. pouch of Red Star Active Dry Yeast at one of the warehouse stores, but they no longer have it available.  I was pleased to find Red Star Active Dry Yeast, 2-Pound Pouch on Amazon and contacted their partner America Anywhere about the products expiration date and the conditions under which the yeast was stored.  They responded rapidly and their information was both specific and accurate.

For home use, I transfer 4 oz. of yeast to an old yeast jar and store it in the refrigerator.  I use a clip to fasten the opened pouch, place it in a freezer bag that I seal and then store it in the freezer until I need to replenish the smaller jar.  This maintains the active aspect of the yeast until several months after the expiration date.

Purchasing Red Star Active Dry Yeast, 2-Pound Pouch resulted in a tremendous savings and, with an expiration date of January 2017, the product is fresh and has enough longevity remaining that I need only use between 9 oz. and 10  oz. to reach the grocers price.  If you bake yeast breads, I definitely recommend purchasing your yeast from Amazon and their partner, America Anywhere.",5.0,positive

"I am not a shake person. Initially I got these for my mother who suffered a stroke. She was not taking food but was amenable to shakes. With 35 grams of protein, these seemed ideal. Additionally they are low carb with no added sugar. But when her tastes changed, I was left with a case of the Frosty Chocolate, French Vanilla and Banana Cream.

These are certainly palatable. The Frosty Chocolate has a mild cocoa flavor. I find it better with a bit of added espresso or cocoa powder. Torani makes a sugar free raspberry syrup that makes this shake extra decadent. The French Vanilla is too sweet for my tastes but is also easily enhanced with the addition of added flavoring. Extra vanilla is good, or the torani sugar free syrups easily enhance the taste.  The Banana Cream is also good, again a bit too sweet for my tastes. A touch of lemon or rum extract helps quite a bit. The shakes are best served well chilled and they do hold you. I have had them for breakfast and was surprised that I was not hungry by mid morning. The texture is decent, not  chalky or cloying. They also serve well as the base for smoothies.

I recommend these shakes. The flavors and textures are good. They provide a generous serving of protein without outrageous amounts of sugars, fats or carbs. Excellent as a pre or post workout drink, they can also provide nutrition to the person on the go or someone recovering from an illness.",4.0,positive

"Unusable filament

The first 2 prints I ran failed in minutes.

At first glance, the spool just looked like it was badly wound, but with a closer look, I can see bits of junk mixed in with the filament and the diameter varies wildly. I don't see how the spools I normally print have been tangle & junk-free in the dozens of spools I've used up, yet this for $2 less can't go 5 meters without a jam.

"After using this product for a while now, I've realized several things why I won't be buying this product again.  First, I noticed that if I sprayed this solution directly at the silicone bead and smooth with my finger there will be ""flashing"".  The edges of the caulk line has problems sticking to the surfaces you're trying to seal.  At first I had thought I used too much but even spraying sparingly will result in flashing.  I ended up covering it over with another line but used water instead to smooth the caulk.  This time I get nice feathered edges with good seal.  After several more tries, I realized the only good compromise was to wet my finger with this stuff and try to smooth a silicone line.  This seems to give a decent result.  For what it's worth, this is an ok product but has a lot of nuissances that I found not worth buying again.  I'll pass...",2.0,negative

"Barbara's Bakery Cereal, Peanut Butter Puffins, 11 Oz. (312g), by Barbara's Bakery.
This cereal is designed for kids. The cereal's title may not sound appetizing, but it tastes reasonably good, although not great, and it may leave your stomach feeling a bit queasy. Maybe my box was a bit rancid, as after eating a bowl, it started me burping, even though the Best By date was still in the future at: 07 June 2015.
This is a puffed cereal, and the internal plastic bag is difficult to open. I am definitely not a weakling, but I had to use a pair of scissors to cut open the bag. After opening the bag, I noticed the smell of peanut butter, and after trying a piece of it, I decided that it tasted like corn and peanut butter. This cereal stands up to milk quite well without becoming soggy.
I gave this cereal one star due to a strange aftertaste, too much peanut butter, the hard to open bag, my unsettled and burping stomach, and the high amount of salt used in making it. (Too much salt can cause high blood pressure and water retention. Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt.) One bowl was enough. I dumped the remainder of the box into the galvanized metal bird seed barrel that I keep on the side porch for over-filling the bird feeder (the doves need to feed on the ground).
At this point, it was too late to return it to the supermarket for a refund.

"I believe that DeWalt thinks this tool works.  But it doesn't.  At least not well.  I say this because they sent it to be semi-professionally reviewed after it already had some bad reviews, and there is a tutorial built into the software reiterating all the should-be-common-sense techniques for proper use.  But following all that to a T still yields frustrating results.

I know my house as well as if I built it from scratch.  I have lots of tools by DeWalt, Bosch, and other companies.  I also have an open mind and patience.  I read the manual and I want this tool to work.  But my results have been dismal.

First - plaster and lathe.  They say that since it may be difficult to properly detect things behind plaster, you should look for ferrous metal and you can figure that that is where the studs are.  Unfortunately, ferrous metal shows up constantly, much more often than it should if it were picking up just nail heads.  And it shows up on the screen as vertical bars when scanning horizontally; this makes it very difficult to imagine it might just be a nail head (and let me reiterate that most of the time it shows metal, it is actually a false positive).  It also shows PVC constantly - and there are only three instances of PVC pipe in my walls, so these are all false positives as well.  Is it possible that the electrical cable sheaths (or other cable sheathing) is showing up as PVC?  What about the dielectric in coax cable?  Even if that explains PVC, it doesn't explain all the supposed ferrous metal.

Even if it those two were correct, why doesn't it ever pick up the non-ferrous copper run constantly in my house in the form of electrical and telecom cables?  It does often pick up live electric, although not precisely.  Sometimes, it has live electric where it shouldn't be and it's not usually dead-on.

Admittedly, 90% of my testing has been with plaster and lathe.  So let me absolutely not recommend it for those applications.  But I also tested it in a few other circumstances:

Plaster and lathe directly over bricks shows constant instances of PVC, metal, and even live electric.  I'd feel a lot better if it showed nothing like it should.  However, if you run it over a wood door with nothing on the other side, it does show nothing there, which is one plus.

Drywall over plywood is probably worse than plaster and lathe, but that is to be expected according to the manual.

I had similar experiences with both drywall and tile directly on drywall (not my design):  better, but still not consistent or trustworthy.  It keeps showing ferrous metal too often, and not enough non-ferrous metal.  No consistency with stud finding, although I'd still use it (averaging four or five passes) to guess at stud finding before just making random holes in the walls or ceilings.

I have a traditional stud finder I bought for about forty dollars in the past (and that was a fairly expensive one).  My experince with this radar scanner is extremely similar - I use it but basically don't trust it and still end up putting holes at the wrong places anyway.  This makes me wonder if this actually uses a different technology or not.  The only difference is that this one is a lot more disappointing considering the price.  Does the Bosch version (that looks about the same for twice as much money) actually work?  I have no idea.

And to back this all up, even if it did detect things properly, it only shows straight bars on the screen when it detects something, so it's not like you're getting a true map.  If it worked and then on top of that had multiple sensors to show vertical, horizontal, bends, and curves, that would be what I expect when I have a little LCD screen to look at.  Actually, even if it works, it doesn't need a screen - it just needs a row of LEDs to tell me what is behind the walls.

I do like the ergonomics of the tool.  I like the handle, the rollers, and the indent for making pencil markings on walls.  I like the case and the rechargeable battery that can be used with other tools.  I really want to love this tool, but in reality it's just taking up space in my workshop and - although I'm sure I'll get it out and try it again - I don't think it will ever actually be of any use to me.  I think it goes without saying that I can't recommend this tool.",2.0,negative

"I have been using HATCHBOX exclusively ever since I got a 3D printer but lately I have been encountering an issue on several of their filament spools. After about half of the spool has been used, there is sometimes a point where the leading filament is looped under the rest of the spool creating a tangle. This has caused failed prints because the filament is no longer feeding through the extruder. This is especially frustrating when I set up a print before I head into work and come home to find the print head moving around in the air because it stopped feeding quite some time ago. This has also created jams in the extruder and it wastes my time having to clear a jam.

However, when it doesn't have this problem, I am real happy with the results. I have given away prints as gifts and made things which I use day to day.

Chocolate chip
Blueberry crisp

Not so. I purchased four rolls of this tape, and so far one has absolutely NO adhesion, and the other I would rate as barely sticky. I got these for a little over two dollars a roll which was a great price, but I would have been fuming if I paid the $6-$7 these cost in retail stores and had the same problems.
For a company like 3M, which generally sells some of the best products, to have such a lapse in QC and allow this type of inferior product to hit the market is sad.

"This company seems to have zero quality control. How else to explain that some of the Chunky soups--which I have happily five-starred-- come from the same company that produced this watery, flavorless concoction? The soup depends upon the  thin yellowish-white stock to establish the ""cheese"" credential but its already mentioned lack of flavor means that whatever this product is, it lacks a crucial ingredient and the word ""cheese"" in the title  is simply misleading. The ""steak""  ingredient is several tiny thin pieces of meat.which lack the thickness, the heft, the substance and the flavor to resemble  the satisfactory beefiness of  even the worst  cheesesteak sandwich I enjoyed  while living in the Philadelphia area.  Finally, the necessary onion component is essentially missing here--I found a very few small pieces of onion so overprocessed  they lend scant flavor. There are also a very few very small potato cubes which, of course, have nothing to do with a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. I truly urge you to bypass this product.",1.0,negative

"When the scanner is occasionally correct, I can't get it to repeat the same reading.
It's readings are all over the place. I scanned remodeled areas of our home where I knew what was in the walls.
Running firmly against new drywall it read, ""lost contact with surface"".
It wouldn't recognize a live wire between a junction box and an outlet.
With repeated scanning it finally showed something there, but showed a PVC pipe instead.
I had similar experiences every where I used the scanner.
There's no way I would rely on this scanners accuracy to access a wall or make repairs

I phoned the number on the box to ask a De Walt technician if there was some secret to the scanners accuracy.
He said ~
> This (DCT418S1) is the first and only scanner De Walt has released.
> There have been complaints of it's lack of accuracy ~ it's been discontinued.
> A factory service center wouldn't likely be able to help with this scanners issues.
> De Walt is revamping the scanner and intends to announce approx July 2014 the release of a new model.
> It's unclear at this time, if the announcement will state the availability to be in 2014 or 2015.
> The battery for this scanner will likely fit the new model. (DCB120 current price approx $28.00)
> De Walt ~ Stanley ~ Boshstick ~  Black & Decker are all made by the same company.
> Products are built for three categories of use, homeowner ~ tradesman (weekend warrior) & industrial.

The on/off button needs held in a couple seconds to come on.
The battery is particular to this unit, so it doesn't fit any of my other DeWalt tools.
The tool has a 3 year warranty ~ the battery is two years.
The booklet is in English ~ French and Spanish

"All of the translucent Solutech PLA filament colors that I have tried (Blue, Red, Clear) were brittle. They also contained an excessive number of air bubbles. On prints with lots of retractions in a small area (aka: prints with multiple small islands), the extruder drive gear frequently grinds through the filament. This leads to failed prints. This sucks. It is possible to down-grade retraction settings and prevent this. However, diminished retraction settings lead to stringing. Therefore, this filament leaves me stuck between a rock (stringing) and a hard place (grinding). It's not worth the trouble. That said, Solutech opaque colors seem to be OK. Colors are vibrant, but filament diameter variation is frequently greater than the stated +/- .03.",2.0,negative

"Come on.  Sometimes you just have to accept that large companies that have been around for a long time, put out a good product.  Like Quaker Oats.

Just like pasta, it takes a little while for water (or milk) to absorb into the oats, and stirring helps break down those flakes as they cook.  Jamaicans also blend raw oats into some of their smoothies, which I thought was an interesting way to make a shake nice and hearty.

"A well priced 3D Printer with plenty of build room. Was looking forward to this and when it got delivered I dived in.
I set it all up, removed the clips and then the fun started.

On Windows 8 the drivers that come with the printer are not digitally signed meaning you have to disable that check in Windows 8 itself before you can install the drivers. If you aren't computer savvy you should get someone else to do it for you or look at another 3D printer instead.

Their website always defaults to Korean where the printer is made which is just annoying.

Then the biggest issue happened, I had everything installed and turned on the 3D printer ready to load the filament but, like other reviewers here, the LCD didn't work. Pressing buttons just caused a beep noise. Without the LCD and working buttons, you can't load the filament to do anything with it. I power cycled the printer but no luck. In the end I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon for a refund. Luckily Amazon has a great returns policy and system to get it refunded.

Hopefully XYZ Printing will sort out their hardware issues in the future.",1.0,negative

"I last purchased this in November of 2014 and paid $1.50 for the 18.5 oz can.  I'm a fan of clam chowder and probably enjoy a can at least once a week.  I like the Progresson traditional version of this product as well.  There are several recipes out there using clam chowder as a main ingredient and in my review of Campbell's clam chowder I included their recipe for spaghetti clam chowder - so easy.

I didn't think I was an artichoke fan until a friend ordered artichoke and ham on a pizza.  Seriously, I know that sounds horrible and it's something I never would have ordered myself.  But when I tried it I really liked it.  So if you're feeling sporty consider trying our this Progresso recipe for Clam Chowder with Artichokes.  It's really quick and easy. Two steps and 15 minutes is all that it takes.

Ingredients

1 can (14 oz) Progresso artichoke hearts
1 jar (4.5 oz) Green Giant sliced mushrooms
2 cans (18.5 oz each) Progresso Traditional New England clam chowder
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup water
  Dash salt
  Dash pepper

Directions

1.  Drain and quarter artichokes. Drain mushrooms.
2.  In 3-quart saucepan, mix all ingredients except salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thoroughly heated. Stir in salt and pepper to taste.

Bam!  That's it.  Very easy and I think it kicks this up a notch.  You can even get away with telling your friends its home made.  :-)",5.0,positive

First off, minimum set up time is 7-14 days, (despite DAP online instructions stating it sets within hours) ridiculous.  After that, it is supposed to remain somewhat flexible like silicone, it does not.  It is gummy and easily punctured with indents appearing randomly even after your smooth bead has begun to dry weeks later.  Second, it shrinks more than any other caulk I have used.  Supposedly the clear shrinks more than the other colors, but I would never use it again anyway so I don't know.  What I do know is that it sets into a thin, and I mean ultra thin layer that is very difficult to get scrape off, which you will most likely do once you see how much it shrinks.  I even set up a dehumidifier to help the curing since it was used for a basement window.  (Two of the uses written DIRECTLY on the tube). The instructions on DAP's site are incorrect about set up time, and I have read of people getting refunds due to this.

"Has 6-7 1/2"" chunks of what they call chicken. It must be from DRIED CHICKEN FEET because it is  tasteless, dry, stringy and one has to chew, chew, chew, ..., and finally when one is tired of CHEWING SOUP, swallow the strings.
The white rice is MUSHY. IF there is wild rice it must be from a city named Wild and not real wild rice.  I suppose they made it mushy so it would be easier to swallow the pieces of reconstituted chicken(or whatever they are).

I bought two of these and the 2nd is going to have all the so-called chicken removed and replaced with chunks from Swanson's canned chicken( which, BTW, actually tastes and feels like chicken ), plus add 6oz of mixed (frzn) vegetables and 2 cloves of sliced garlic.  ...or just throw it away. (I'd give it to Food Bank to be used but why do that to them? They have enuf problems... ). It might be fun to watch a cat try to chew the pseudo chicken chunks but that would be cruel.

But when I go through the return process it states the item is not eligible for return and provides me a link to the return policy.  Of course I can not find anything that is associated with this device.  So...the product is good if you can accept a failure rate of 1 in 6 and can accept a no-return policy.

"I have been using HATCHBOX exclusively ever since I got a 3D printer but lately I have been encountering an issue on several of their filament spools. After about half of the spool has been used, there is sometimes a point where the leading filament is looped under the rest of the spool creating a tangle. This has caused failed prints because the filament is no longer feeding through the extruder. This is especially frustrating when I set up a print before I head into work and come home to find the print head moving around in the air because it stopped feeding quite some time ago. This has also created jams in the extruder and it wastes my time having to clear a jam.

However, when it doesn't have this problem, I am real happy with the results. I have given away prints as gifts and made things which I use day to day.

"I must be the odd one out here. Now, I don't know if this is a bad batch, if Amazon is the new Family Dollar, or if this is just the ""new"" recipe for Frosted Flakes. I grew up on Frosted Flakes. As a pre-teen, I ate them every day. As a teen I ate them quite often. I ate them with milk, I ate them straight from the box, I ate them with melted marshmallows like a Krispie treat. As an adult, I've had them occasionally. I hadn't had them in a couple of years, so I got some... from Amazon... mailed to me in my Prime Pantry box.

These are not the Frosted Flakes I grew up on. They are not the ones I ate every day as a pre-teen, nor quite often as a teen. Neither are they the ones I used to make ""Rice Krispie"" bars a few years ago. These are corn flakes with barely any frosting on them at all. There are two things that make Frosted Flakes better than regular corn flakes... 1) The sugary frosting that makes them sweet without having to add extra sugar and.. 2) the sugary frosting that makes them sweet without having to add extra sugar ALSO makes them more crunchy and makes them last longer in milk before they go soggy.

"The KA3005D looks good in the pictures, has nice feature set, small footprint and low price, a perfect bench power supply for my home lab.

"No I don't hate these (no one does) BUT I do hate the PRICE! The regular size rice krispie treats sold here on Amazon are a fraction of the price ($3.67 for 12.2 oz, which if you do the math would equate to about $5.50  for the same 19 oz)
Okay so maybe you have wee little ones who wouldn't eat the whole square (cos near as I can tell these must be about 1/4 the size) but I can't really imagine any kid not being able to eat a one ounce rice krispie treat anyway & you could buy like 3 boxes of the 'big' (regular) size rice krispie treats - 36 full size treats instead of 50 mini 1/4 size squares. Now why do I care? I mean I do understand you pay more for the smaller portions for convenience packaging - but Amazon keeps baiting us with the other item being ""not available"" for us so clearly it's this way overpriced (super) mini-treat or nothing. Especially when they offer coupons on items thy're already out of, which would make them even cheaper - make the difference in value even greater - it's super insulting. I don't think they should offer coupons on items they don't have in stock - or they should honor the coupon when they gt the item in stock, like a raincheck.

I'm sure these taste great & if money's of no concern then go for it but everyone else - live & learn. & that's unfortunate too, because a lot of lower wage earners couldn't figure out the cost differential on this bait & switch ponzy since the cost is per each & the weights are so dissimilar.",1.0,negative

"Excessive difficulty in assembling - some parts simply wouldn't snap together until near breakage point.  I had to go into ""Zen mode"" and become one with the vacuum cleaner before I could get it fully assembled.  Emptying the dirt cup and cleaning the filter was easy, however putting the dirt cup back onto the vacuum cleaner was a real pain in the you-know-what.  I tried my best to follow the directions which say to align it up and then press down.  I kept wrestling with it for at least 10 minutes and still it would NOT snap down.  Finally I hooked the back latch over the it's notch, and then using it as a hinge I was able to get the front snapped.  Voila.  (I'm writing this in as a note to myself in case I forget the trick to it).

However, once you get through the ""parts"" part, it does a good job of vacuuming. (See UPDATE at bottom of review) It has a very powerful motor.  With various selections for the type of carpet, including bare floor, I chose the one for short carpet and I could definitely feel a strong pull from the vacuum cleaner.  It also did a great job on the bare floor in the hallway.

Having no bags to buy is nice but the filter gets real dirty real fast.  I will probably remove the filter every time I empty the dirt cup and use the included brush to clean it with.  It says you can wash the filter but I haven't done that yet.  The hose attachment is nice and pliable and the suction is very good through it.  I used it to vacuum the stairs up to the second level of our home.  Since the cord on the vacuum cleaner is very long, I didn't have to unplug it to find a closer socket as I approached the top of the stairs.  It stayed plugged in the bottom electrical socket.  I had to bring the vacuum cleaner up with me as I went higher and higher up the stairs and it stayed well balanced on the step or two below the one I was vacuuming.  My other upright vacuum cleaners want to lean forward and fall down the steps.  This one stayed in place.

I don't know how long the motor will last.  My other two vacuums are at least 20 years old each and still running good but they don't suck as strongly as the Eureka.  It's a heavy vacuum so I will probably keep it downstairs and use the others for the upstairs.

Overall, it's good, but I sure didn't like the assembly or trying to place the dirt cup back on.  I hope that after more experience with it I will be able to snap it back on quickly.  I certainly hope so because it seems to fill up quickly.  It comes with lots of attachments to get to those cracks and crevices.  I will have to be sure and empty the dirt cup before attacking our sofas.

UPDATE:  11.5.12

O.K. I've had this thing for a while now and I'm NOT nearly as impressed now with it as I was when I first wrote this review.  It no longer picks up trash from our short carpet (yes, it's at the correct height setting) and drops as much trash as it picks up.  I empty the dust cup frequently since it fills up so fast but now it's hardly picking up any carpet dirt.  One of our dogs chewed up a bathroom rug and there were 1 inch strings from the rug on our carpet.  It would not suck any of them up but instead they all got wadded together in a ball and the vacuum started bouncing.  Honestly, I can't recommend buying this thing.

"I bought these nails because I didn't need that many 3"" ring shank for my Hitachi NR90 nailer. Very few carry over 2 3/8"" in a ring shank, and those that do charge about $30 or more to ship. So 500 nails for $30 with free shipping was worth a try.
The nails look like someone made them by hand. The coating is very thick and not uniform; so the ""ring"" portion is a hit or miss affair, leaving some nails looking as though they had virtually no rings at all. Some of the nails were also slightly bent; not an issue when using a hammer, but hopefully it won't jam my nailer.
I test shot a strip, shooting a short piece of Timberstrand dimensional lumber into another piece of Timberstrand (I rarely use pine 2 by's). Nailing into Timberstrand requires more nailer power which my NR90 had no problem with.
On the plus side, the nailer worked fine and the board was extremely difficult to dislodge from the other board using three of these nails; so I think they'll work for my purposes.

"I have become a regular Zevia fan but it did take a bit of adjustment to the taste. I had not been addicted to carbonated drinks in the past but did, occasionally, ""binge"" on pop and cheetos. In an effort to get off of sugar I researched options and was impressed by the health benefits of low-glycemic stevia which is the sweetener used in Zevia. I actually grown stevia (also called ""sugar bush"") and, yes, it really does have up to 100 times the sweetness of sugar with none of the bad side effects. A tiny bite of the plant will overwhelm you with sweetness!

However, it doesn't taste like white sugar so it does take getting used to. My favorite Zevia flavor is Cola. I've tried most of the other flavors but find Cola tastes more like regular pop. It's worth the effort to switch. Once you do, you'll find that reaching for an ice cold Zevia is, indeed, refreshing and healthful!",4.0,positive
"I bought this toothpaste because of the flavor - and it is very good for toothpaste. I can't recommend this though for several reasons: the box promises to freshen your breath with Scope and to whiten your teeth. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually do either of those things plus you get a lot less than a normal toothpaste.

The ""Scope"" part of the gel immediately liquefies once in your mouth instantly cutting the gel on your brush in half. The very small amount of ""Scope"" isn't enough to freshen your breath for more than a few minutes after brushing. Plus, since we lose about half of the gel in the tube, we are effectively buying half the toothpaste, as that of a standard competitor 6 ounce size, for the same cost (or more - this same toothpaste is available at Wal-Mart for about $2).

The ""whitening"" claim is also misleading as the whitening that you and I think of when we buy toothpaste is an additional chemical that works to lighten the color of our teeth. The ""whitening"" that Crest is talking about, though, is the same you would get from rubbing any toothpaste on your teeth: the toothpaste in conjunction with your brush helps scrub the stains off the enamel of your teeth. Crest isn't the only company to do this. I recently went down the aisle at a local store and found that most of the toothpastes advertising ""whitening"" have in small print that they scrub your teeth of surface stains, i.e., they clean your teeth not actually whiten them.",2.0,negative

"Several spools I own have jammed.  Some when it is brand new because the filament got fouled in shipping.  Some were my fault - until I realized my error was pushing the filament back into the cartridge can also cause trouble.  The issue is the same either way, a loop of filament slips off the spool and tightens around the axle causing it jam.
Many of the holes where the filament leaves the cartridge are too small and this also causes issues.

I opened it up and fixed all problems- but why should I and they make it hard to do so.

The cartridge is opaque so you cant see in it to see if there is a snag or to see how much filament you have left. Bad design.

I will also note- a spool I got had been clearly been broken open- which may mean they shipped me a refurbished spool - at full price.  And it was snagged... so they didn't even refurb it well.",1.0,negative

"Five DISTINCTIVE Stars. This boxed Bumble Bee ""Snack on the Run!"" comes in a box containing a zip-top small can with 2-3/4 ounces of tuna fish salad, 6 ""buttery"" round crackers, and a small plastic serving spoon. This tuna salad flavor is distinct from the other Bumble Bee flavors by the addition of garlic & onion, rosemary, and sea salt. The tuna salad also has mayonnaise, celery, and water chestnuts to add a crunch to some bites, all of which tastes very good. This is a snack, not a meal, but it packs a fat, protein, and carb punch. Nutrition Facts for the 1 small can tuna salad & crackers:

-Tuna-220 calories. Total Fat-18 grams: Sat fat-3 grams, Trans fat-0 grams; Cho'esterol-20mg; Sodium-340mg; Total Carbs-7g; Fiber-1g; Protein-6g; Vitamins A & C-2%, Iron & Calcium-4%.

"About 1/3 - 1/2 of these clamps failed at the point of installation. I would turn the screw and it would tighten for a while but when I made the ""last"" turn to make it as tight as I could (where the adjusting screw doesn't turn any more), the screw would just turn freely and the pressure exerted by the clamp would disappear. I've never had a radiator clamp strip before and I'm not a super strong twister of screws. So I was pretty surprised at the rate of failure. I bought several different boxes and several different sizes and had the same general experience with all sizes and lots.

I don't know the nature of the failure. And I don't know whether the clamps that didn't strip are durably strong. But I use them mainly to connect pipe and fittings in an underground irrigation systems. So the cost of fixing a broken clamp is very high in terms of lost water, time to locate the leak, time to dig up the joint and time to redo the original job. I sympathize with the reviewer who lost an engine using these. These clamps have a low price but are very expensive in the long run.",1.0,negative

"I was always jealous of my cousin, Tony. Her mother bought crest. My mom made us use pepsodent. I can remember how wonderful crest tasted. Tony and I used to sneak into the bathroom at her house, squeeze the crest onto our fingers, and eat it! Like a treat!

Fast forward many many years later and I decided to give crest a try. The idea of actively removing gingivitis made the product all that much more appealing.

After ordering and receiving the crest pro-health I noticed, while reading the label, a warning that it had an ingredient that could cause staining. I researched Pro-health and staining and decided not to eat the crest anymore! Brown teeth! Stains that need removing professionally by a dentist. The reports of stringy mouth goo and tongue numbing. Now I know you can't believe everything on the internet.. but there is a lot of scary anecdotal evidence out there, and a lot of alternative products that don't use the staining fluoride found in the crest. Personally I don't choose to take the chance and find out. This is a pass for me.",2.0,negative

I had previously used an off-brand very inexpensive packaging tape and never had any problems with it not sticking. In fact the cheap tape was very sticky, so much so that if you pulled it off the package, it pulled the top layer of the cardboard with it. On the other hand, the expensive Scotch Super Strength tape pulls off any package with no problem. I am using 2-3 times as much tape (criss-crossing it) as I did with the cheap tape. So the Scotch ends up costing me 4-5 times as much. Overall a real reputation killer for Scotch brand products.",2.0,negative

"I wanted to upgrade to a larger, 3L flask for making larger yeast starters for home brewing.  The flask arrived in fair condition, unbroken.  However, with numerous scratches and a couple bubbles in the glass, I'm going to assume that these flasks are factory culls from China, sold at discount prices.

I tested the flask with some water on my stir plate and found that the raised shape of the bottom prevented the spin bar from staying in place.  It took only a few seconds before the spin bar was thrown to the side.  Regardless of what speed I set the stir plate, the bar would quickly fling off the center.  That makes it unusable for use on a stir plate.

The flask is being relegated to other tasks, such as mixing ingredients.  But due to all the scratches and bubbles, I am hesitant to attempt heating anything in it.  I really don't want to be showered with glass shards.  In the end, a rather expensive bottle.  I will spend the extra $$$ and buy Pyrex or Kimax brand in the future.",2.0,negative

"I really like the Closys products, and a few year baseline indicates that it is at least a good and maybe a uniquely good product for me (fewer deep pockets, and generally great gum health).

I wanted a small mouthwash bottle with which I could travel, and had been using improvised solutions, but the 100mL bottle appealed to me and the label would make it a little easier to distinguish in my travel bag.

I discovered, though, upon unpacking after my first trip, a terrible flaw in the design of the mouthwash bottle: the bottom lip of the cap bottoms out on the shoulder of the bottle before the cap top seals to the threaded neck of the bottle. In short, the foolish thing leaks by design, and with pressure changes in aircraft, it is not academic.

I unscrewed the cap and (carefully) used a razor blade to slice off the bottom few mm of the cap, and it now seats well to the top. This should not be necessary! So: 5 stars for the product itself, minus 3 stars for the lousy design.

But the Compressor Saver is also good (3 wires with one connecting to the common / ground on the Contactor relay). They both work the same way - the Potential Relay detects the pickup voltage (back EMF).

"This filament is a very bad quality. I tried 3 different filaments from this brand and they all are very bad in every term. I used two other filaments in the past and they are both much better, not even comparable to this one. One good thing in this one, is that it does not smell bad as ABS usually does. But it makes me wonder whether it is ABS at all or not.

If you want an advice, I recommend Hatchbox filament, it prints beautifully, this filament is a junk, not a real ABS I believe, but some mixture. For those of you who will think I work for Hatchbox, no I am not, you can open my review profile and see how old it is and how many different reviews are in there and none of them are related to this niche :) I recommend Hatchbox sincerely, I only bought this one, because hatchbox was out of stock that week. I filed a return for this one and replaced with black ABS from hatchbox. By the way, SainSmart TPU is horrible quality.

"This printer should not be on the market. This is beta Kickstarter trash that was haphazardly retrofitted into a product. The version I have is the newest ""R1"" model. From the moment you power on the printer, the nightmare begins.

First you're given a horrible 3D printer software called MatterControl. The interface crashes when you minimize the window (At least on Windows 8). It also has the appearance as if it was created in the 90s. Many times you'll notice it fails to detect the printer.

Usually the first thing most people will do is play around with the X, Y, Z controls for the print head and watch the head move up, down, left, right, etc. However, if you control the head too low on the Z axis, the leveling switches will get loose and spin uncontrollably, and possibly get their connections permanently severed... pretty much self-destructing your brand new printer. I went on the robo3d forum to complain... but some guy named ""Mike"" said the solution is to not go too low on the Z axis, because MatterControl doesn't ""respect"" the switches. Are you serious!? Then why are the switches there in the first place!? Derp?

Before I continue, this is pretty much all the support you'll get from Robo3d... A guy named Mike on the Robo3d forums... Their support center is pretty much non-existent.

You'll get a few, maybe a dozen decent prints before more problems occur. First thing that you'll run into is probably the filament drive gets jammed or slips filament in the middle of your print... The solution the forum suggested was to buy a new ""hobbed bolt"" from eBay. Really? Did they build this in their garage!?

Next thing you'll get is an uncontrollable plastic leak from the top of the extruder's heat block. This is ""common"" according to Mike.. The plastic accumulates on top of the block, burns into a black liquid, and then falls on your print while releasing visible fumes. The black stuff hardens into nasty-looking boogers and causes the print to fail. There is no true solution to this, only a risky and potentially destructive tightening method that requires you to heat the extruder to almost 300C! While you're trying to work on the printer (which is what you'll be doing most of the time), the blue LEDs, while cool, blind you until you are forced to tape them up.

Maybe a few weeks in, things start getting very sad.. The filament drive jams even more, the leak becomes a flow, and you realize its almost impossible to print anything but the simplest items on this... Last but not least the fans over heat and fail (mine caught on fire), rendering your printer absolutely useless until Robo3d can send you a new parts, which on the forum I've read cases where it took several weeks (or even longer) to get replacement parts. Besides the parts replacement, the warranty is completely useless. Robo3d will not send you a new printer if it dies on you. In fact you'll be lucky if you even get a response from them. Only ""Mike"" on the forums might be the only help you get.

Thankfully I bought the printer from a retailer that has a decent return policy, and was able to get a refund for this hunk of junk! I just ordered a Dremel3D :)

"Blech! This is basically expensive Jif peanut butter. It has sugar and palm oil. I did not read the ingredients. It said 'natural' peanut butter. So palm oil, sugar (dried cane juice LOL) are from nature. They are found in nature as they are plants. But calling it 'natural' is misleading since one is thinking 'oh, all peanut peanut butter' rather than 'peanuts mixed in some oily miasma that is terrible for the environment (palm oil),  raises cholesterol and blood sugar.'

It doesn't taste good if one wants one's peanut butter to taste liked the butter of peanuts. I almost spit it out when I first tasted it I was so surprised at that tasteless margarine smooth oil flavor & texture.

Anyway, it is exactly the same thing as Peter Pan, Jif and the like but packaged in a way to fool you in thinking that it's actually good and healthy peanut butter.",1.0,negative

"Opened the first packet of this salmon and put it on top of cream cheese and cucumber on a wasa crispbread. The first thing I noticed was the salt...a bit too salty for me.  I've never had seafood in these packets before so was surprised how flattened the fish was...guess there's no way to get around that.  Parts seemed 'dry' and it appeared 'clumpy'.  It had a good salmon taste and smell.  My blind kitty headed right for the smell as I opened the packet...she likes it too.  Pretty expensive for kitty food but nothing but the best for her, she ate the little I gave her, then my other kitty came in to clean up the rest.  I would have rated this higher if it wasn't so salty.  It's convenient and easy to use and for just me eating it, I like the packets better than a can, I just roll the top down and put it in the refrigerator for tomorrow's lunch.

Conclusion: I will use this more for a salmon salad as opposed to eating it straight, the saltiness will be better handled with mayo to calm the saltiness.  I think I will look for a no salt variety next time.

Note: I never salt my fresh salmon when cooking it, so what may be a salt issue with me may not for you.",4.0,positive

I am happy to report they they liked the fruit cups!

Mandarin Oranges was the favorite choice with both kids and adults, at the end of the day there were no Mandarin Orange cups left (there were a few Cherry fruit cups left).  The fruit cups are 80 calories and 18 grams of sugar which is pretty good (a fresh apple, for comparison, is on average is 80 calories and 15 grams of sugar)

I recommend these fruit caps as an option to a healthy desert!

"It does quite well, what a glue does best---glue ! Odd to me, activated when glue applied only to WET surface, then it EXPANDS before getting hard. Example-glued handle to broom end, and glue expanded a lot, squeezing out around joint. Required sanding that off, for appearence.  Example--glued broken porcelain chip piece to toilet tank cover...used very little glue, BUT glue expanded and raised chip slightly above crack area---whereas piece fit perfectly before the glue, and could not see any broken area. Now stuck with this slightly raised chip, above tank top----not perfect. The glue does great holding job & wanted something besides epoxy for general use. Will be looking for a more NORMAL acting glue to replace it. Just use very little glue, wet surfaces, and best to clamp pieces together or use heavy weight-----this might keep glue from doing excessive expanding. I will NOT recommend this glue or give it more stars, because before bought it, was not told about wetting surfaces or expanding problem of glue. Use sparingly, for sure.  /  BTW - not bought @ Amazon....Note; the Gorilla TAPE is very good...it sticks better than duct tape, especially in wet weather. 6/27/2014  ---  TOOK OFF AS MANY STARS AS POSSIBLE....the expanding property of this glue has messed up most repaired things.  If glue expanding so much is okay for your use, THEN I'd rank it as GREAT !  I'm old fashioned -- just want stuff to stick together without, for whatever reason it does, bubbling up...forcing pieces to spread apart. ALSO, any glue that has bubbled out by the joint, has to be sanded away---which is hard and ackward to do, if not impossible.  IN OTHER WORDS...0 stars.",1.0,negative

"I ordered these because they reviewed well (at the time) and they were a great value, or so I thought.......

They are literally thinner than paper around the edges and the edges are half the liner. I'm strangely uploading a photo, haha... I took a pic over black fabric so you could see they are literally see through thin. The bill is just there to reference size.

I wouldn't use these on light days at all, they're just pretty useless. For everyday wear they also dissapoint in that they only stick to my panties (mostly Victoria's Secret, cotton) for maybe half the day. Beyond that, they fold down or bunch up and are just really annoying.

The only thing I prefer about these over the Carefree brand is that the box isn't as overly large. Individually wrapped is nice but not important to me. I'm frugal so I keep using them although I really feel they're just useless and I want to dump them in the trash, lol!

The fact that they are thong shaped didn't earn them two stars, in my opinion. Folding over any other liner (wings or not) would be better than these. They're also rather short in length but mainly just way too thin and they don't stick.

Needless to say, I won't be buying these again and I don't recommend them. Hope this helps someone! Smile.",1.0,negative

"So when this soup first hit the market about a decade ago it blew my mind. It had nice big bits of chicken in it, and was loaded with vegetables and rice. The flavor was mind blowing full of herbs tasted better than fresh homemade soup, in fact for years I have tried with my homemade soups to get the same amazing sage flavor that was in this canned soup and have failed.

I loved this soup and then it was gone, couldn't find it anywhere anymore.

I was so happy when I found this on Amazon. It came I opened the box heated up a can right away and was so disappointed.

There are hardly any pieces of chicken in it now, seriously there were like two pieces of chicken in the first can I opened. Hardly any veg, except for tons of nice cheap carrots, how do I know carrots are cheap, because that's what this is a can of carrots. There is not even much rice in it. Worst of all the flavor is gone, no more amazing herby greatness, just kind of a watered down version of it's former self.

"These are awful.  Purchased as a quick meal option for busy season at work, I ended up disappointed every time I attempted to make one of these.  Every single cup ended up with me eating sludgy rice and cleaning out the office microwave. I tried using less water, colder water, less time in the microwave... I even tried using different microwaves and adjusting the power settings.  It appears the cooking directions are wrong, it has to be because every single cup spilled all over the place.  Just to prove it wasn't an issue with me, I asked someone else to make it for me one day with the same results.

I can make Easy Mac and any other kind of microwaveable food out there.... except for these Rice A Roni cups.  I'd like to tell you they at least tasted good, but I wouldn't really know because the flavoring went all over the place when they overflowed in the microwave every time.  So unimpressed and I definitely won't be buying these again.",1.0,negative

"I initiall gave it 1 out of frusteration but as others mentioned you learn alot from this machine.  But as mentioned you will be putting out more money.  Currently I am replacing the power supply, motherboard and another hot end...To be fair when its running its great.  But since I have had it its been issue after issue.

3/27/2014

After learning from my initial mistakes and applying a few body modifications I have reached to a level of print quality and consistency that has exceeded my expectations. 5 stars.

Update: 5/6/2014

After fixing all that can go wrong with this machine, it will not function for a long time.  All those five star reviews are BS because look at those dates.  Eventually they will all come back and re edit there reviews.  The motherboard doesnt last long.  I went through 4 and they went away with the replacement program.  And thats when I stopped putting money into it.  At the moment its paper weight. With all the upgrades, hotends, motherboards etc its not worth it.  You will eventually have to go to another motherboard.  Total BS.  My next machine will cost thousands.  You get what you pay for.  ALWAYS.  People say its a good educational tool.  There right.  You will learn not to make the same mistake again. Give those five stars some time.",1.0,negative

"I got a bad batch. The ABS was mixed with some other thermoplastic, possibly PLA but it could be anything. I only found out when I tried to dissolve some in acetone. ABS plastic dissolves completely in acetone leaving you with a mixture that you can use as glue on your heatbed, or to glue two pieces of ABS together. You can also use acetone vapor to chemically polish the surface of an ABS printed part, it's one of the great reasons for using ABS to print. This filament did not dissolve completely, there were strands of another plastic left behind that acetone does not dissolve. No matter how long I left it to dissolve, this other plastic remained, contaminating the whole bottle and making a mess.  So the filament is defective and I'm returning it.  Hopefully this is just a single bad batch and not representative of the product as a whole. I attached a picture of a sample of red ABS next to another brands grey ABS.",1.0,negative

Perhaps my favorite feature of all is that the product spreads smoothly and easily--without any strawberry clots!

"I bought this to go with my new shop sink.  I also bought the gallon of liquid soap shown on Amazon that is a suggested co-purchase.

Now that I found out I won't be using it that doesn't matter whether I can open it or not.

I don't see any reason to purchase any device or product based upon the ink jet cartridge system.  It also doesn't appear that well constructed so it probably wouldn't hold up to moderate use.  I would suggest another soap dispenser.

It took longer to fabricate the sink cabinet so I did not get around to installing the soap dispenser until it was too late to return.  I fault Amazon and the supplier for not providing information on how this product must be used.  There is no excuse for omitting critical information from the displayed product literature nor suggesting soap that can't be used in the device.",1.0,negative

They are thicker than construction paper but not what I expect out of an index card.

They are true to size and have easy to see, vibrant lines on one side.  I will use them but not for anything I need or expect to last.

It doesn't cold vapor smooth on many of the prints when using acetone. Even when it does smooth it isn't uniform in the smoothing.
I did a few test of dissolving some of the pieces that didn't print well and they don't dissolve in the acetone.

This leads me to believe this is not 100% abs filament but is contaminated with some other plastic. I will finish this roll off on non critical prints and try a different brand.",2.0,negative

I like that the top is grippy and large and has handles, but the wheels make it absolutely not worth it - not to mention the terrible smell that needed cleaning and airing out for two days before my (failed) usage.

I almost gave it two stars because the top isn't terrible, but since the wheels make it unusable for me... I feel nothing but negativity toward it.

"I personally love that I can mix up a perfect bowl of delicious Butter & Herb mashed potatoes in under 5 minutes. The 4 ounce pouch makes 4 servings at 110 calories each. The nutrition label states each serving contains: 2.5 g total fat (2 saturated, 0 Trans), 510 mg sodium, 20g total carbs (1g dietary fiber, 2g sugars) and 2g protein.

The package provides two directions on how to make the potatoes: stovetop and microwave. They are basically the same: boil 2 cups water, add pouch, stir, serve.  That really is all there is to it!

Let me just say these are very tasty! Rip the pouch open and the aroma of herbs stir the senses as it is blended into the water.  Let it sit for a minute...it really does help to stir until moist and let set a moment.  If you are having company or if presentation is important to you, I recommend that you scoop out the mashed potatoes from your mixing bowl and place in a clean bowl.  This prevents others from seeing that you reconstituted them with water.  LOL  They really look like the hand mashed potatoes and taste smooth and creamy.

"Summary:  This is a pretty weak orange and cinnamon spice.  I did not like this and I would not buy this again or recommend it.

I am a big tea drinker and orange and spice is one of my favorite blends.  Being a Twinings fan in general, I was pretty excited when I am across this blend of orange and spice.

But I was sorely disappointed.  The flavor is very mild--even when you overbrew it--and the orange flavor is very week.  The cinnamon flavor also is muted, as it takes a back stage to the other spices included.  I have shared this tea with 2-3 other people, and neither enjoyed it.

If I was given this tea, not told what it was, and told to guess what it was, I would NEVER have guessed orange and spice.  The flavor is just weak and not characteristic.

Twinings tea is very good in general, but in my honest opinion this falls short.  I didn't give it one star because it was still drinkable, just not particularly tasteful.",2.0,negative
I did not find any benefit with these sheets and they were much more of a headache to use than anything else.  These are thick; so thick that the extruder height will need to be adjusted so that your nozzle doesn't rip right through.  These are also VERY sticky which made removing them a huge pain.  The sheet will rip right off the glue.  I had to use Krud Cutter and a razor blade to scrap the glue off my bed.  I have an aluminum bed as a point of reference.,2.0,negative

"UPDATE: While this VG *used* to be made from coconut oil (when I gave it 5 stars originally) they switched to palm oil in 2015-2016. So I switched to Duda VG, made from 100% soybean oil and it blew ED out of the water. ED also makes soy-based VG now, but at the time I was looking to replenish my supply (about a year ago) they only offered it in 4-gallon packs. Everything else was palm-based based. That's when I found Duda VG. And I'm never going back. Priced as good as ED and can buy it in 1g quantities. I really like soy VG, even over coconut VG, and it's much more sustainable as well (even than coconut). Never going back!

Essential Depot VG is the best, bar none. Made from coconut oil, never animal fat. Tastes delicious, always fresh, and vapes like a dream. Can't beat it. Once you try Essential Depot VG you will never buy anything else.",1.0,negative

"The accuracy of these is fine.  However there are scores of other calipers that are also accurate.

The digital display is too small and has poor contrast - reminds me of the first Casio digital watch I owned in the 1970's.  Times have changed and an 8 mm digit size doesn't cut it anymore.  The mushy buttons are nothing special - buttons with a positive tactile click are preferred these days.  The resistance to sliding is quite high - not as easy as the newer competing units.  Not a big deal maybe, but it imparts a low quality impression.

"Pros: came with all the attachments I wanted, including an excellent one for wood/bare floors; good suction that's adjustable; roller on/off option; bagless; reusable HEPA filter, well made, long cord.

Cons: this machine is very heavy, and when using it in the fully assembled mode with the carpet brush, it's too tall to go more than 2-3 inches under any furniture; cord not retractable (I know--picky, picky).

I like the lift-off option for versatility. However, the unit is heavy to carry around and the hose is in an inconvenient location when vacuuming in that mode. I am 5'6"", and it's almost too tall for me; a shorter person might not be able to manage it.

With time I'll get more familiar with all the release buttons. I have two high pile shag area rugs which it cleaned very well. However, even with the suction adjusted to the lowest setting, it required two hands and a lot of effort to push around on those rugs. It's fine on my larger low/no pile area rugs, but I have to stand on the smaller ones to keep them from being moved around during vacuuming, and the corners tend to be sucked up.

Overall, I think the pros and cons are even. For me this is fine, but it's not my ideal vacuum, which is out there somewhere.

UPDATE 4/17: I'm done with this hulk. I find it very inconvenient to switch between floor and rug, and using this on rugs is like pushing a wheelbarrow full of concrete blocks. $200 down the drain.",1.0,negative
"I love this stuff! I ""discovered"" Gain detergent & other laundry products because they were good buys in the Prime Pantry & I love lavender.

My towels are super soft after using this product & are still absorbent after 3 washes.  NOTE: If you don't like strong scent in your fabrics - don't buy this - it has LOTS of perfume - mostly lavender.

I try to keep the ""candy"" content of his diet down to a minimum, so I switched over to the smaller miniature marshmellows. He barely noticed. In any case the Kraft brand is excellent.

All of the previous spools I had purchased were vacuum sealed with moisture absorbing material sealed in as well.  This spool came unsealed with none of the normal stickers or little temperature card that were in EVERY other spool of 3d Solutech Filament I have bought.  It actually looks like the spool was returned and I got the returned spool in the regular 3D Solutech box, as there was no clip and the filament was very loosely wound on the spindle.

"I bought this cream reading all the positive reviews .They were a few that said that it broke them out .So i thought y not give it a try. I have dry sensitive acne prone skin with  the occasional pimple that bursts out with stress climatic change etc.

The first day i used this cream my face felt hydrated and plump like a very very deep nourishing moisturizer.nothing else . I thought it stayed on my face for more than 24 hours . The next day i woke up with a cystic acne on my chin, i never get acne on my chin ever . And 2 days it flared up. Immediately stopped using it .

Will i recommend :
Very good moisturizer plumps  hydrats as mentioned . If you apply before going to sleep you will wake up with hydrated skin.  But for people with sensitive skin run the other way . Causes pimples in places you have never got before.",2.0,negative

"This is the WORST chip I have ever tasted in my life....Now, keep in mind this is just my personal opinion, but the best way I can think of to describe it is so: Imagine you went down to whitecastle and picked yourself up a bunch of sliders...You gulp them down, and you ate so much that you got sick, and vomited it all up. Then someone comes a long and dehydrates your vomit, and compresses them into chip form and packages them up to sell to you.

To me, that's how it tastes! It has a slight sour taste combined with a very strong whitecastle(And ketchup) flavor. It was so bad, that I almost threw up. My stomach kept going into convulsions and I couldn't eat anymore.

To be fair, I gave the rest of the tube to my cousin, and he seemed to love them...So, judging by that, and most of the reviews here on Amazon, I am very much in the minority I guess. Still, for me? This is something I will never touch again, and I love Pringles, but a part of me isn't even sure if I can look at a tube of chips again without getting sick.",1.0,negative

They are great for baking, but not so good for eating on their own as a snack. They are OK for salads or topping oatmeal. Toasting/roasting helps a little with enhancing the flavor.

"I bought this tape thinking it would be better than duct tape.  It wasn't.

Yes, Gorilla tape is sticky.  And yes, it's probably stickier than duct tape.  But that doesn't mean it's as strong.

I taped a plastic crate that I use for hauling packages to the Post Office.  The side of the crate had cracked and needed to be repaired.  I used a a good three foot strip of tape that extended half way around the crate.  After a few weeks of use the tape completely failed - it literally split in two like masking tape.  I simply pulled the crate out of the back of my car and one of edges of it (the crate, not the tape) caught on the bottom.  I tugged a little and that little bit of pressure popped the tape right in two as if it were nothing.  I have never seen duct tape behave like this, not once.

One more thing - this tape has a horrible odor.  Think wet dog or old socks stink.  Whatever you use it on will stink for days.

Not sure if I just got a bad roll or if other reviewers used the tape for other purposes.  But there's no way I'd ever buy another roll of this.",2.0,negative

"I can get past the lack of any useful documentation/instructions, pain getting the software and drivers to work in x64 Win7 or Win8 but the unstable software and hardware were too much.  The scope software would intermittently drop out the USB connection/communication to the scope hardware module regularly on ~3 min intervals after about 10 mins of operation.  I tested on two separate computers one with Win8 and one with Win7 with same behaviors.  It only seemed to work fine for measuring low voltage square waves.  The main reason I wanted this unit was for secondary ignition waveforms and it did not work at all for this usage scenario.  Upon connecting the supplied BNC HT ignition probe to any secondary ignition cable, the software would not display a waveform, it would and say it was searching for a signal and sometime it would even crash the computer OS.  My guess is a driver issue - I did however download whatever I could glean as being the latest drivers from Hantek's web site and also checked their support bulletin boards.  Very disappointing overall experience as I wasted a good bit of time trying to get it working.  The only upside is Amazon stood behind the product and processed a return for me.

"Mixed feelings. I purchased these as an option to prevent over measuring / overuse.  As Clorox liquid reformulated to a stronger concentration I was concerned because the gasket of my front loading washing machine was showing wear (gray faded).

I switched to this product and was happy that they were self contained but disappointed that:
1. I had damage to my Clorox brand dish towels; The Clorox tablets ""melted"" the fabric of the Clorox dish towels and they had only been washed 5-7 times. The washer was filled with 12 dishtowels and a tablecloth.  I would only use these tablets if you have a very full load; they are strong and could possibly damage fabrics

Update 12.15.17:
My fears were true - the gasket area that had worn down to a lighter color a year ago has truly cracked in the weakened area.  The new HE machines just don't use enough water to rinse out this product out of the machine after the cycle is over.

Update 3.18.18:
Indeed had to replace the inner gasket of the washer - after it was removed I found two other hairline cracks.

My end assessment remains - not enough water in the front loading washers to completely rinse this product free of your washers gasket.
Of note Amazon sells replacement gaskets and although it was an off brand it still fit the drum of our washer.",2.0,negative

"I used this when I found myself running up against the clock and needed Mexican rice in a hurry!

"I am an certified Auto AC technician and installed this valve pursuant to the directions to recharge a sealed refrigerant system.  After the install, I checked for leaks and the valve leaked, I tightened the screws more, and still a leak.  I then tightened the screws to the max and still a leak.  Now I have a hole pieced in the tubing and need to cut out the pierced tubing, solder new tubing in place then return to the original problem which was low refrigerant.  This time I will cut the tube at the compressor, vacuum the system and crimp/solder the tube to complete the repair.  What I'm left with after purchasing this valve, is wasted time, the money to purchase the valve, spend money for the tubing repair and will have to buy another can of R134A.  Don't waste your time with this valve.  Complete the repair properly the first time and save your money and time.",1.0,negative

"I've been eating this and and competing similar products as a part of a dietary meal plan, so I thought I'd share my experience. I'm not going to focus on nutritional details since that's readily available on the package. Instead I'm focusing solely on subjective experience, and since I ordered a wide variety of similar products I'm going to use a standard template because I'm lazy that way.

PREPARATION: Unlike the other entrees I've been eating, this one had some assembly required. Opening the package reveals a covered bowl containing a large plastic package of noodles, a smaller plastic package of teriyaki sauce, and two tiny foil packages containing dried vegetables and sesame seeds. The instructions called for putting the noodles in first, then the vegetables, then the teriyaki sauce, then two tablespoons of water, cover loosely with the lid, and microwave on high for 90 seconds. Given that the vegetables were dried I opted to put them in first (so the water would have a better chance of reaching them) and that worked well. Heating time was accurate; 90 seconds in a 900w microwave oven on a rotating plate, followed by a one minute rest, perfectly heated the entree.

OBSERVATIONS: The vegetables are an honest-to-goodness joke. I understand that they need to be so tiny in order to properly rehydrate during preparation, but the quantity of vegetables is so tiny and their contribution to the dish is so meaningless that I don't even really understand why they're included in the first place. There's MAYBE a tablespoon of vegetables in here and they add nothing in terms of flavor or texture and almost nothing in appearance. The teriyaki sauce is thicker than I would have preferred, and is not as strong as the teriyaki sauces you might encounter in a restaurant. I prefered this, actually, since I'm not a big fan of strong teriyaki sauces. The noodles, of course, are the star of this dish...but it's a dim star. The noodles are gummy and sticky with an unpleasant rubbery feel in the mouth. The teriyaki sauce helps reduce the stickiness of the noodles but not enough. Partway through the dish I added a tiny bit of sesame oil to what was left and gave it a good stir; that helped quite a bit, though the unpleasant mouth feel remained. The sesame seeds were nothing special but DID add a bit of welcome texture variation.

VERDICT: Not really digging this one and likely won't re-order it. The mouth feel of the noodles really spoils any hope for improvement of this dish, but I DO think there is room for improvement. Doubling or even tripling the vegetables would go a long way, I think, and even though this is a vegan dish I think it would be a lot more satisfying with a couple ounces of chicken in there.",2.0,negative

But with the size, they can help protect a reasonably good sized wound better than ""standard"" size bandages.

Don't use these on sensitive skin!  The adhesive does its job very, very well.  But when the bandage comes off, it's going to hurt if it's on sensitive skin, or an area with a lot of hair on it.

"I wanted to try these as a slightly healthier alternative to Teddy Grahams.  These are organic and have a few less ingredients.

FLAVOR:
With three flavors of ""bunnies"" you get a medley that is kind of nice.  However, only the chocolate ones have enough flavor to even compare to a Teddy Graham.  The chocolate chip has a very, very mild chocolate flavor, but isn't too bad.  The honey flavor is pretty bland.  Honey Teddy Grahams have more flavor, so I'd choose them over plain honey bunnies.

TEXTURE:
These bunnies get stale very fast.  Seal them up well, or you'll have bad tasting bunnies.  Fresh, they're crispy and crunchy and a great size for on-the-go snacking or sitting at your computer with a cup of coffee and these little cookies.

OVERALL OPINION
I do like the organic factor.  However, they're generally a little more money than their competing Teddies, and I like Teddy flavor better.  It's up to you and your taste buds, but I would at least recommend trying the bunnies.  I buy them when they're on sale for cheaper than Teddies.",4.0,positive

For half the price you can get:

Item number TF125P-E
Body and Nut Polypropylene
Washer EPDM
Internal sealing washer Polyethylene
Color Black
Thread 1-1/4"" FPT
Hole dimensions 2-1/4""

Now, with the above, you will have to ream the hole a bit. Takes about 10 minutes with a spade type drill bit, or a couple of seconds with the right size forstner bit. On the inside of the tank, you will have to use the drill bit to remove a very small amount of plastic from the support ribs on either side of the hole. The plastic used for the one I listed is like PVC. It is hard and tough. The nut also threads on much deeper and has a much better grip on the bulkhead ""passthrough"" portion of the fitting. Buy the alternative and save yourself a bunch of money over the long run.",1.0,negative

"This vacuum (for the unit I received, anyway) should never have left the test table at Bissell.  When it is started, the belt is misaligned so badly between the motor that drives it and the beater bar that the belt shreds, as it pushed its way to the end of the beater bar.  After about 10 minutes of use, the plastic floor guard that internally houses the belt guides inside, breaks where the belt relentless pushes on it, while shredding itself to death.

This vacuum cleaner that I received is an epic fail by Bissell's design and/or manufacturing dept, and a certain fail by the apparently non-existent testing process that should be occurring wherever these units are made.

They really have improved upon these compared to when they first came out with the product.  The strips do actually stay on with a grip on your teeth, which makes the process a whole lot easier!

"This test is fairly easy to use and understand. You pee into a cup and dip the end of the strip in it for 10 seconds. After you wait 5 minutes you check the test. The line that tells you the test worked always showed up very dark. The line that tells you if your positive or negative is not.

I don't like that the line for positive or negative was either invisible or barely visible. I took the tests every week for months and could not see any difference in the positive or negative line. The first 6 weeks I saw nothing. After that I started to see a bit of red on the right side of the line. According to the test anything means you are negative, but this test is not very reassuring. This test should have a better and more visible reading.

If you have a test that will decide your employment or your freedom I would not trust this test. Not using for months is the only way that I know I am clean and this test did not help me at all. The main reason I bought this test was to have some idea of when I would be clean to find new employment. It told me nothing and I still had to wait it out and let time take it's course.

"I purchased yellow and red as my guinea pigs, I usually use ABS ( and can't get back to it fast enough). Not sure whether I'm just used to ABS or what, but I had nothing but trouble trying to get decent, even layers with this stuff. I use SAIN ABS and haven't had issues, other than tight windings in some earlier spools, but this stuff was ornery from the start. Some layers needed more heat, some farther in the print needed much less heat, because they were sinking into the prior layers.

I lost two different hot end nozzle holders with fractures that happened due to curling prints. It actually was comical. We had a contest to see what would happen next; a broken holder, a melted layer, prints lifting when PLA isn't supposed to lift. Fan was on from layer two on.
I have two rolls of unopened other colors I will be either selling or pounding into paste with a sledge hammer. Probably the latter. ABS is where it's at, as long as you're into ABS slurry to glue it down. Elmer's glue on PLA is a waste of time, as is PLA.

"L'Oreal is nuts for labeling this shade as ""light."" This product is not just darker than ""light"" should be, it's extremely orange. I can't envision any skin tone that this color would match, it's really unnatural. Imagine the worst spray-on tan you've ever seen, and this comes close.

In addition, it's a very heavy coverage, nothing like any other BB cream I have used. Note: this cream squeezes out of the tube white, then develops the bright orange color when you blend it in. The photo below doesn't do it justice, it's far worse in full coverage.

"These are quite simply poorly made bottles. These bottles leak onto your hand when you squeeze the lever. This is not good if you are using  cleaning products at the time. Also, this makes a mess on the floor.

My husband decided to take one of the spray units apart to see what was wrong. It turns out that the nylon plunger and the barrel don't make a good seal. The nylon has a very uneven edge that lets liquids get by.  You can smooth the working edge of the plunger with an emery board or sandpaper if you are so inclined. It is likely that you will break the lever in the process, so why bother?

I have to chalk this one up to experience and move on. If you do buy these bottles and yours leak too.....you could give these as presents to people you don't like - if you run out of other ideas. Please don't give them to me.",1.0,negative

"Buyer Beware!  This package actually contains 9 sets of plain Pringles, 6 Sour Cream and 3 Cheese.  The way they are stacked, and by use of the window cut (so you can see in the package), would have you believe there are 6 of each, very deceptive, and just plain unethical.  The manufacturer will probably reply, 'The counts of each type of chip are written on the side.'  Yeah, but your use of a window-cut display deters anyone from reading the side, and you know it.  Why would anyone read the side to know what's in the box if you think you're already looking at the contents of the box?  It's classic bait and switch.  This is clearly meant to deceive, people don't buy variety packs to get overwhelmingly plain chips, and you know it.

This makes me not trust you in general, and people need high trust in food manufacturers since we put their products into our bodies.

So good job, you got my sale this one time, but you've just cost yourselves dozens (or more) future Pringles purchases from me, and I am going to tell a lot of people about this, probably for decades, each time I see Pringles or if they come up in conversation, or anytime someone talks about unethical and deceptive business practices.  Send this review (and the other negative reviews on this site for this product) on to the 'hotshot' that thought deceiving customers to get a one-time purchase was a good idea, and please also send this to their boss.  You've bought so much ill-will from me and cost yourselves so many future Pringles purchases, and you did it so needlessly, all over saving yourselves a few cents... on just one sale!  Unbelievable.

"I tried to like this center. I really did. It's big, it feels substantial, and it's exactly what I'm looking for. The first one felt like it had positive stops every quater of a turn. I figure in any production line there will be duds, so I had Amazon send me another one (thank goodness for Amazon's easy return system). The second one is better, but I can still feel the bearings grind when I turn it. Hooked up to the lathe, at slow speeds, it feels and sounds like a pepper mill grinding pepper- not the smooth, quiet live center I was expecting. Still hopefull, I called PSI directly, figuring they would find me a good one and send it to me, I don't doubt all the other reviewer have good ones, I'm just seeing some poor QC up the chain. Anyway, I could hear the technician's superviser talking to him in the background, and he basically said that's how it's supposed to run. Maybe it will get better with time, he tells me. He said if I wanted a quiet, smoother center I should look into their more expensive package (~$80). I was pretty surprised since they advertise it as a ""smooth running"" center.

I am now wondering what else Kashi is lying about, probably about everything. To me Kashi is a very disreputable company for doing this and I will never buy another Kashi product.

"Instead of the blue Rockler brand gauge shown, I received a white Drillspot brand gauge with a large label covering the gauge markings. The label was the kind with permanent adhesive. Attempting to remove the label left most of the label and adhesive stuck to the gauge. Using a chemical to remove the label might remove the painted gauge markings or damage the plastic. I contacted the seller (Drillspot) to give them a chance to fix the problem before I left negative feedback. They declined to take any corrective action and said to let Amazon deal with the problem.

The plastic gauge shipped loose without any type of packaging. With Drillspot's logo, phone and web address printed in large type on the gauge, it appears to be the type of giveaway item you get free at trade shows.",1.0,negative

"This potato chip is amazing!  Each chip is crisp and enticing.

I ordered this in July and the Best Used By date was 30 October. Of course in my home, they would never last that long! The chips are safely stored in the thick bag and to my astonishment, there seemed to be no broken chips and the bag actually looked full when I opened it (none of that 1/3 full bag after settling stuff).

The ingredients are simple and natural: potato, oil, sea salt.  The bag of 8.5 oz provides about 8 servings.

The chips themselves are as described by the maker: bold flavor and have a hearty crunch. Each chip has a unique look like a fine piece of art that makes the mouth water in anticipation.  And let me tell you, they taste heavenly.

Only potential drawbacks: 1) they are really crisp and may cause some discomfort if your mouth/gums are sensitive/sore, and 2) it is difficult to eat only the suggested serving of only 13 chips.

Overall, awesome, and mean AWESOME chip!",5.0,positive

"This brand makes the best potato chips. Crunchy, flavorful, all-natural ingredients, light - they almost taste home-made. The texture and crunch of these chips are amazing. And the taste is just perfect. They are high in calories - 150 calories for about 13 chips. One serving, or 13 chips, contains about 15% of your fat. Good news is sodium is low - about 5%. No sugar. 5% carbs. Sea salt and vinegar is a unique combination and blends wonderfully.

So, there's no real nutrition to speak of, somewhat high in calories and fat for a small amount. But for a treat occasionally, 4th of July picnic, why not splurge? There aren't better tasting chips out there. I like the dark ones, too. The company seems to support environmental endeavors, which is a plus.",5.0,positive

"ORIGINAL REVIEW --------------
hese cookies are thick, fluffy, chewy and relatively soft. Perfect as a heathy dessert alternative when you feel like dipping into the snack cabinet after dinner. Great balance of oatmeal, raisin and flax. I don't feel guilty eating these and they are more filling than the less healthy junk food!

Check out the ingredients list it's full of great stuff.

Did you know 1 cookie has over 20% of your daily whole grain target? SWEET.

Be sure to check the label if you have any food allergies.

I bought these at a lower price locally but I hope to find them at a comparable prime price soon on Amazon.",5.0,positive

"If you're into gel antiperspirants, and haven't given this a try, I give it a thumbs up. It's worth trying. I'm not super picky about deodorants, as long as it lasts a while, smells ok, and doesn't make me sweat like a pig, I'm all for it. So far, so good with this stuff. The smell isn't unpleasant, but I've smelled better stuff as well. It's kinda just a fresh light scent. Definitely not overwhelming, you can barely smell it. I don't think the scent would be an issue with this stuff for anyone. It does seem to work ok as an antiperspirant. There are definitely a couple downsides though. One, it doesn't seem to last very long. It says 48 hours on the packaging, but hah, not even. I feel like no deodorant lasts 48 hours, but this stuff will definitely not last that long. I'd say a day, which is really all you should need anyway. If you put it on in the morning, don't expect it to be as good as new by night time. Some deodorants will really last 24 hours, but I don't think this stuff does. Maybe 12-18 hours is more realistic. But most people shouldn't need deodorant to last longer than that anyway. The other issue is the packaging. Oh my god let me tell you, worst packaging ever. Half the time the thing you use to scroll it up doesn't work. And then when it does work it squirts out way too much. BUT I HAVE FOUND A SOLUTION! First thing you need to understand is that you are probably putting way too much of this stuff on. You do not need a lot. Just a very, very thin layer on your underarms and that is it. It should not be a thick glop like most people probably try and do. If you have excess, do not put it on your underarms - trust me, more is not better. I have noticed that when you scroll it up, the scroll thing MOVES up but it doesn't always come out at the top. Here is what I do. I scroll a tiny bit of it up, then I VERY CAREFULLY squeeze the container on the sides. Hold the stick at a 90 degree angle to your eyes so you can see when a tiny bit (I'm telling you, you do not need a lot) comes out. It doesn't take a lot of squeezing. Then, let go, and apply it to your underarms. Do the same thing with the other side. This is the best way to get control over how much comes out of this. Do not rely on the twist up thing like most dry deodorants. The packaging allows for some flexibility and it should be enough to get just enough of the product out as you need.",4.0,positive

"I have been using the original Head and Shoulders shampoo & conditioner 2 in 1 (only as a shampoo) for years. I have always loved it and did not intend to change, but shopping in prime pantry section I noticed a discount on this one and since it was also 2 in1 and head and shoulders, decided to give it a try.

I have came across couple of fake head and shoulders shampoos in my life and it was easy to tell from smell and texture and then after washing the hair with it, the result is pretty obvious. Since this one was of another ""flavour"" then the one I usually use, I couldn't tell if that is the reason for it to have different texture and smell (it smells somewhat like a candy or a chewing gum, not ok for a shampoo!) or the low quality, but after having washed my hair with it, I can definitely tell it is nothing to be compared with the original one. My hair is slightly damaged, and it needs proper care for it not to get worse and I try to give that care as much as I can. Yes this shampoo is cheap, but I would rather pay couple of dollars more and get the proper shampoo for my hair.

Overall I do not like it and do not recommend it to anyone. I am pretty disappointed to see that Head and Shoulders company is selling this low quality shampoo itself on amazon!",1.0,negative

"I enjoy a variety of beverages with my meals, and just for refreshment. I've tried any number of bottled teas and I like some of them. Personally, I've always thought that most were either too sweet (whether with honey, sugar or artificially flavored). I was mentioning this to my wife the other day and she came up with a packet of Ito En (Oi Ocha) Japanese Green Tea and suggested I try it. She said it came from Costco, but it's probably available elsewhere or here on Amazon. Well, I took a bottle (16.9 ounces) pored over ice and a later bottle chilled ice cold in the fridge. Excellent. Much better than other brands. Very smooth and light tasting with a ever-so slightly bitter aftertaste. Quite refreshing! Goes well with food. I particularly like the absence of any sweetness of any kind. Plus it has the antioxident qualities of green tea and a surprisingly high vitamin C content. It's a very quality beverage.

"While this PEI surface on my printer bed is good for adhesion, I had serious problems getting this sheet to stick to either the aluminum bed or a glass plate even using 3M 468 adhesive.  The problem is that the sheet of PEI I received was warped about 1/2"" over 12 inches length.  I did not think this was a problem and mounted it, then ended up stripping and remount it several times.

That small, permanent warp in this PEI sheet caused no end of problems with it lifting off the bed at the edges.  PEI is flexible but does not conform well and tension always existed at the edges.  A flat sheet from another supplier has not had this problem.  I'm testing to see if mounting it with the warp down will work any better, but frankly don't have much hope for it.  Perhaps what I got is an anomaly, but I've wasted a ton of time trying to get this particular product to work properly.",2.0,negative

Tried all kinds of drops, not just these. Almost all of them made me have to use more and more drops all day. In other words, irritated my eyes worse than they already were. A friend suggested that I try normal saline drops. It was a miracle! I started using them and immediately my need for eye drops lessened. Now I don't use anything but normal saline, and mostly first thing in the morning and in the evening when my eyes get tired. I'm happy to not be putting all these chemicals into my eyes anymore.

"Bought this unit to operate the chute on a 47"" snowblower.  Just installed it today, Dec. 12.  It operated nicely for about 4 or 5 cycles.  Then it stopped working.  I went to return the item, to late.  The unit was purchased Oct. 22, had until Nov. 22 to return it..  Since I could not return/exchange it, I opened the end of the unit and found when it was assembled, one of the power wires was pinched resulting in the wire burning off.  This failure was without a doubt a manufacture fault.  Because it did not get put into service within 30 days of purchase, the failure of the manufacturer is now my problem.  SO, if you purchase one of these, put it in service as soon as you get it.",1.0,negative
"I have an old old Colgate Via-jet 7500 that I have used for 20 years.  I encouraged my daughter to buy a water pic. She got the Waterpic WP900 with the pic and toothbrush. Well, she gave it up shortly after getting it and I inherited it.  So I put my trusty Colgate machine away and tried the Waterpic. I was also eager to try the fancy electric toothbrush. However I got no brushes with my unit. When I went to purchase brushes I was turned of by the ridiculous price. As a matter of course,  I boycott any company and product that I consider to be price gouging. Once I began to use the machine I found it to be very flimsy and light. Touch it wrong and all the bits fall off on the floor including the top, tool compartment, and wand. I had to remove all these bits. The machine's performance is no better than my old unit and the base and motor compartment is also light weight and prone to tumbling. When all is said and done, I prefer my old unit and have switched back to using it. If a product is flimsy and jiggly, it is not nice to use. For a device costing this much I would expect more robust build quality and reasonably priced accessories.",1.0,negative

It appears to be 21mm x 2mm straight thread.  A nut is provided, so it is clearly meant to be a bulkhead fitting.  A 1/2 NPT fitting can be forced on about three turns.  After that the torque required is so high that the valve's body is likely to break.  For low pressure, using a lot of teflon paste sealant, it might do, but I'd expect leaks at anything over about 10 psi.

The 20oz bottles are great though because it has a cap and you can place it back in the fridge until you want it again.

Stewart's Orange cream is hard to find, though I did find one place I could get it and did for a few years but now their website changed and only sells baskets of candies/chocolates from different decades 1940's to 1990's plus some other foods that were either discontinued or hard to find anywhere else in your area.

"I've kept a bottle of Tabasco (the original blend) in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit. I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to ""kick up"" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.

I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.

After purchasing and taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old versus new notes  ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested.

Tabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.

I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm very certain you will be pleasantly surprised.

1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar with a hint of sugar and garlic. Available in most supermarkets. Praised in many reviews and rightly so. Look for a large bottle with a rooster on the label.

2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers and available in most supermarkets. Look for the wooden top.

3) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting) featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar - widely available

I hope I've encouraged you to try a few other hot sauces.

PS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost hard to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a ""plus"" in my view but rather a ""minus"" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!

What more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce.

UPDATE (August 2013): While my review was written over a year before - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED HOT SAUCES.

 What sauce came in very LAST?
 Tabasco!

 What was first?
 Huy Fong Sriracha.

"These are seriously the lowest-quality bearings I've ever bought.  I bought them for fidget spinners but I wouldn't even use them in kids skate/skateboard wheels.  I tried everything to get them spinning well:  Removing the shields, cleaning with acetone, alcohol, limonene, soap & water, etc etc.  I also tried various types of lubrication (oil, grease, or none at all).  These things are just plain JUNK.

Even fresh out of the box you can hear them clicking as they turn due to scratches/imperfections in the *supposedly brand new* ball bearings.  The retaining clips inside (that hold the bearings inside) are an odd transparent brown color that I've never seen before (I've taken apart thousands of bearings in my life; normally they're white/""natural"" nylon colored or metal)...  Like they were permanently stained by rust or something.  I suspect that these bearings are made from rejects at some factory and the internal retention/spacer clips were pulled from some batch that was recovered from a flood zone.

They're also a fraud!  The metal shields claim these bearings are ABEC-9 but they are most certainly not!  ABEC-9 bearings would not have as much ""play"" as these hunks of junk.  Shields or no shields these things just plain *wobble* and if you spin them fast enough (e.g. with an air compressor like I used to test them) they *literally fall apart*.  I'm never going to find those ball bearings that flew across my garage.  That was with like 3 seconds of compressed air.  A normal ABEC-9 bearing would be able to hold strong (getting a little hot) while being spun by compressed air no matter how long you spun it.

Avoid these bearings or just use them as weights if you have that kind of fidget spinner.",1.0,negative

It is only 12 inches long including the buckle so unless you are Barbie it is pretty useless for anything personal except perhaps securing your paddle to your kayak.

I obtained a 3/4"" strap 24 inches long with a more appropriately sized buckle for less cost. All other NRS straps state their length and the ""One Person"" is shown after the 3ft, 12ft and 20ft so the assumption is that the list is in size order.

I bought this container because I don't like the packets with all the extra sugar and fake flavors and I am pleased with the taste and how easy it is to prepare. But the container is super small. I didn't realize how few servings an 18 ounce container would be. I would have to buy this every week or more just for myself and my husband who occasionally has some. But I guess that was my bad. I didn't really look at the servings per container. We always had these big containers of oatmeal when I was a kid and they lasted a long time. I am almost done with this container and it's only been a short while. Walmart has the 42 ounce canisters for just $1.00 more I will buy my oatmeal there from now on.

But that aside, the taste is great, the small amount of fat is poly and mono which are both good fats with just a touch of saturated which isn't. In all, a very healthy and versatile product. I will be buying the the big container though because the large container is a better deal and I won't have to buy it as often.",4.0,positive

"The only reason I give this can o' beans 4 stars is due to the price. At many stores, and other locations where one might procure beans, specifically in a can, they tend to be closer to the $1 range.
However, if you have the tendency to stay at home, forget things at grocery lists, want to stay lazy for a bit, but still want your can o' beans, then these beans are here for you, just as they once were there for me.
It is nice to see the large organic label on the front of the can, though to claim that beans are vegetarian seems a bit excessive; I would be concerned if my beans were made of meat. This may be to avoid confusion with beans that are sometimes mixed with meat in the same can, but these are usually clearly labeled, and often have so little meat that it's practically vegetarian anyway.
Regardless, these beans served their purpose well.
Black beans work especially well in chili mixes (or any bean other than refried/mashed, but I prefer the black bean), and a vast array of other concoctions. As some people mention, they weren't mush, which is good, and all the beans were thoroughly cooked. Of course, I expected both of these things; if I ate an uncooked canned bean, this would be getting a 1-star review.",4.0,positive

"I ordered this item along with probably a dozen or so other items about a month before our move. When 'Big Move Day' arrived and we encountered our first heavy item, we remembered that we had the lifting straps. So here we are in 90 degree weather, sun beating down on us, and I pull the bag out and open it up that contains these straps. All that was in the bag was the straps.. no instruction sheet.. not even a picture of what the straps look like in-use. After looking at the straps, in the heat (literally) of the moment, we tossed the straps aside as it was too much trouble to pull out a computer to look at a picture that might explain how to use the straps.

By the time I did get to a computer to look at a picture of the straps in-use.. I had already moved many of our large items using a combination of a dolly, furniture dolly (square tray with caster wheels), and ratcheting straps. It appears that the straps have to be sized to the item that you are lifting and the height of each person. So there appears to be quite a bit of ""setup"" just to get to the point of being able to use the straps on an item. In the meantime, I could have just lifted the furniture onto a furniture dolly and rolled the item out of the house into the moving truck.

"For most of my clothing, I prefer to use Seventh Generation or something similarly eco-friendly, bio-based, and free of the synthetic fragrances and stuff you'll find in most detergents. However, when it comes to gym clothing, you occasionally need something a bit stronger. For those things, I use Tide + Frebreze for the first wash and then send it back through with no detergent to get rid of any detergent that might be lingering on the fabric. The main reason I do that is because I've found that the clothing still smells pretty heavily of Tide when it comes out, and I'm pretty sure some breakouts I had for a while were related to this detergent. They only occurred where the clothing washed in this detergent had touched, and they stopped when I started sending things through for a second rinse.

So in short, I'm not crazy about this detergent and it seems to make my skin unhappy - but it does a great job of removing weird smells from clothing you or someone else has worked out in.",4.0,positive

"Purchased this item to replace an older Hoover that, while it still worked, really showed its 10-year age (attachments broke, seals weeping, etc.)

Did a fair amount of research, and no matter where I looked, every model from every manufacturer seemed to have about 5-10% of the ratings at 1 or 2 stars.  Most of these were motor failures.  This unit fell in the lower range of failures, so pulled the trigger.
.
Out of the box, it's easy to assemble (slide-in the handle, and turn a lever), and easy to use.  The dual-action brushes worked well.  They also stop rotating when the handle is locked upright (nice if using the hand-held wand).  Water and solution tanks aren't the largest, but more than enough for an average-sized room (and their smaller size makes the machine smaller and lighter).  Plenty of suction, with the suction nozzle designed to remove for cleaning (simple lever to remove).  All these newer models have the handheld wand as a separate unit, so the unit itself is lighter with better suction and the hose is easy to clean.  When it worked, it was a great machine.

Now, the downside.  Used-it 4 times without incident - twice for ""regular"" room carpets, once on some stairs, and once to clean carpets in a car.  Each time, I cleaned the tanks and hoses, rinsed and cleared the brushes, then toweled-off the unit, storing it in a closet.  Started using it the 5th time, and it just didn't sound the same.  Noticed an unusual odor after less than a minute, and another minute or two later, the motor just stopped.  Double-checked everything, just to be sure there were no obstructions, but wouldn't turn-on.

Fortunately, it was within Amazon's 30-day window, so back it went for a refund, and on to purchase a different model.

Due to its short life, my personal experience is a 1-star, but I bumped it up to 2 stars because it really is designed well (if mine just had a better motor).",2.0,negative

The cookies were melted and stuck together so it almost looked like a roll of dough in the packaging. I wasn't a fan of melted, crushed cookies BUT my hubs and children didn't mind... they just ate em with a spoon",2.0,negative
It doesn't really work too well. It's a week old and I cannot hold it and turn it on with the same hand. I have to hold it with one hand than use the nail/finger of my other to turn it on. Also it kind of wiggles; wouldn't call it vibrating or pulsating or oscillating.,2.0,negative

"I bought this toothpaste because of the flavor - and it is very good for toothpaste. I can't recommend this though for several reasons: the box promises to freshen your breath with Scope and to whiten your teeth. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually do either of those things plus you get a lot less than a normal toothpaste.

The ""Scope"" part of the gel immediately liquefies once in your mouth instantly cutting the gel on your brush in half. The very small amount of ""Scope"" isn't enough to freshen your breath for more than a few minutes after brushing. Plus, since we lose about half of the gel in the tube, we are effectively buying half the toothpaste, as that of a standard competitor 6 ounce size, for the same cost (or more - this same toothpaste is available at Wal-Mart for about $2).

The ""whitening"" claim is also misleading as the whitening that you and I think of when we buy toothpaste is an additional chemical that works to lighten the color of our teeth. The ""whitening"" that Crest is talking about, though, is the same you would get from rubbing any toothpaste on your teeth: the toothpaste in conjunction with your brush helps scrub the stains off the enamel of your teeth. Crest isn't the only company to do this. I recently went down the aisle at a local store and found that most of the toothpastes advertising ""whitening"" have in small print that they scrub your teeth of surface stains, i.e., they clean your teeth not actually whiten them.",2.0,negative

"The Geatex GXT60 Dual Laser thermometer gun is a nice looking thermometer. It has a nice weight to it and is a nice size. It did not feel like a toy. I read other reviews complaining about the battery compartment and screw. They must have redesigned it or they were referring to a different model. The GXT60 battery compartment just has the front of the handle that swing down and you snap on the included 9 volt battery after you remove the plastic wrap off the battery and swing it back up to close it.  It has all the features that I wanted, high alarm, low alarm, max temp, min temp, avg. temp, differential, adjustable EMS, data hold temp, laser on/off, backlight on/off, dual lasers and a pouch. But the main thing I wanted it didn't have and that was an accurate temperature readings. It was 5-10 degrees off. I tested it against another IR gun, home thermostat and an instant read thermometer. All three of the instruments were 1/2 degrees different from each other but the Geatex GXT 60 was at least 5 degrees lower from all three. What good is a thermometer if it can't give accurate readings? If it was maybe 1-2 degrees off I can maybe tolerate it but 5 degrees, no that won't do. I might have received a defective one but I'm not going to exchange it. I received it today and I'm sending it back tomorrow to Amazon for a full refund.",2.0,negative

"I posted a picture in the customer images section showing the light against skin from this otoscope compared to my LED flashlight.  The light from the otoscope has a blue tint and the colors appear flatter (lower apparent CRI - Color Rendition Index) compared to the LED flashlight.  With the flashlight, the skin looks normal and with the otoscope it looks cold and pale.  The LED bulbs with the higher CRI are newer and more expensive, so the manufacturer has slightly older LED bulb technology in this otoscope.  This is significant because it is harder to make out subtle signs of conditions if the colors are not as vibrant.

Other reviewers noticed the same blue LED tint, for example the previous review here from Kenneth S. Raper, MD where he writes ""Also the LED is blue-ish instead of white. Very much like the first generation of 'white' LED string Christmas lights that had a blue tint. This makes eardrums and mucous membranes look odd. It makes it difficult to tell how red a throat is, or if an eardrum is a little red or not. Normal pink mucosa (in a blue-ish light) has a slight purple-ish hue. This is really the only disappointment with the product, but it is significant. I expected a white light.""

I wanted to like this product because the price is good, but I'm returning this for a different brand with a halogen bulb for more accurate color.

The product package says ""Designed in Texas and manufactured exclusively for Innovative Innovations Inc. in China.""

Update: after I posted this review, the manufacturer posted messages trying to attack me on a personal level simply because I didn't like the blue LED.  Then I went through other 1, 2, star reviews and found the same rude behavior from the manufacturer in the follow-up comments to legitimate reviews from doctors and nurses.  A quick web search reveals that this company has highly aggressive marketing tactics for low quality Chinese medical knockoffs, with an F rating from the Better Business Bureau.

Some useful information on the Amazon Customer Discussion forums:

- ""Always read the negative reviews. Many fraudsters will post hundreds of positive reviews, but the truth can be hidden in that one genuine negative review thread.""

- ""Always check the time frame of the reviews. Were the majority of positive reviews written over the course of a very short period of time? This is a red flag.""

- ""Compare the number of reviews with similar, well-known products. If, for example, an unknown company is selling vitamins with more reviews than Centrum or One-a-Day, this is certainly a red flag.""",2.0,negative
"These pieces of dried fruit look like they might have started out as apricots, but they are mostly brownish-black with a few spots of brownish-orange.  They look like the fruit was allowed to over ripen before being dried, and they taste that way too: so over ripened as to be almost nothing but a little fiber with fructose and no flavor of apricots whatsoever.  If you're looking for a soft, very sweet dried fruit with little real flavor of its own to add sweetness to a dish, these will be just the thing.  If you're looking for dried apricots that actually taste like apricots, give these a very wide berth.  A few astronomical units should do.",2.0,negative

"I have used a different but similar cart for years, and the bed finally split.  I don't like one wheeled wheelbarrows, because the load is high and they are easy to tip.  I see no reason to spend any more than the $50 this one costs.

1. The floor is not flat, as my old unit was, to make it easier to mix the load with a shovel.  However, it seems that the flat plastic floor style of my old unit is not as strong as this style of plastic, and this style also makes a narrower cart, which is easier to get through some spots. Unlike the old cart, I don't see any areas that are weak by design. I figured that I should be able to get at least as many years out of this cart (5 or more).  Unfortunately I got less than 1 year.
2.  These wheels are large enough to roll easily, although not as large as my old cart.  I did not want tires that pump up--my experience with those is that eventually they don't hold air anymore. That style is expensive to replace or repair.  The wheels on the old cart are still good, and I estimate that these will be good for some years to come.
3.  The cart dumps well, and the walls are higher than most.  It lists a 200 pound capacity.  Unless you are a 27 year old weight lifter or farmer, you probably won't want to carry more than 120 pounds in a cart anyway.  It does not bend when I dump 40 pound loads at a time into it.

"The only reason I give this can o' beans 4 stars is due to the price. At many stores, and other locations where one might procure beans, specifically in a can, they tend to be closer to the $1 range.
However, if you have the tendency to stay at home, forget things at grocery lists, want to stay lazy for a bit, but still want your can o' beans, then these beans are here for you, just as they once were there for me.
It is nice to see the large organic label on the front of the can, though to claim that beans are vegetarian seems a bit excessive; I would be concerned if my beans were made of meat. This may be to avoid confusion with beans that are sometimes mixed with meat in the same can, but these are usually clearly labeled, and often have so little meat that it's practically vegetarian anyway.
Regardless, these beans served their purpose well.
Black beans work especially well in chili mixes (or any bean other than refried/mashed, but I prefer the black bean), and a vast array of other concoctions. As some people mention, they weren't mush, which is good, and all the beans were thoroughly cooked. Of course, I expected both of these things; if I ate an uncooked canned bean, this would be getting a 1-star review.",4.0,positive

"These were OK. Flavor and sweetness level was good. They are chocolate and have chocolate chips in some of them.

However I found them to be hard and kind of dense. Like the dough doesn't rise at all during baking. Teeny tiny chocolate flavored bricks. Hard to bite into. Doesn't easily soften in milk or your mouth. You really have to chew these. My 2 and 4 year old were excited about these at first but probably found them hard to eat because after a couple I found them spitting slimey crumbled up bunnies all over the floor. And they didn't want any more...ever. They would rather eat saltines than these.

I kept them a couple of weeks but the kids never wanted them so I threw them out. It's great they're organic but who cares when no one (not even me) wants to eat them.",2.0,negative

"When you are ill, not much tastes good. I force myself to drink, but eating is another matter. I have found, however, chicken noodle soup goes down easily. Now, you can try the chicken noodle soup in the red and white can. Lots of memories of that soup fr9m child hood. But, I found as I grew older that Progresso chicken noodle soup was the next best thing to homemade.

There is more sodium than I would like, but all in all, the noodles, the veggies and the chicken are far superior. Opentge can. Heat an$ eat. If you can eat some crackers with your soup to give you some substance. One of the best meals when you are sick and you just want something good.

Then I use Crest White Strips to maintain my teeth's whiteness afterwards. I am able to maintain very white teeth with this regimen despite that I regularly enjoy  coffee, tea, red, tomato sauce, and soy sauce. I don't see the point of this toothpaste.

"I have ordered these twice about a year apart.  In total I purchased 6 units.  5 of them read within a % of each other.  One is way off...by 10 to 15%.  Although I would have liked all 6 to be matched this is not bad for such an inexpensive device.  I use mine to check my photographic equipment humidity box and to check the levels in the house.  Good product.  Have not bothered to contact Amazon or the vendor about the one bad unit.  Perhaps I will....perhaps too much trouble.  I am pleased with the product.  BTW two of my units (both read accurate) have been running over a year on the battery....so I think this is low battery consumption.  Very pleased.

UPDATE 5/27/16
I lowered my rating to two stars.  This review is not only the product but on Amazon.  Yes Amazon ..I have been a PRIME member for several years and make many many purchases.  I decided to return the one bad unit and the online information states I have till June 2 to initiate a return.  But when I go through the return process it states the item is not eligible for return and provides me a link to the return policy.  Of course I can not find anything that is associated with this device.  So...the product is good if you can accept a failure rate of 1 in 6 and can accept a no-return policy.  I figure this is worth 2 stars.  Sorry Amazon....I still love your service but this time you did not come through.",2.0,negative

"Smart Start Antioxidants Cereal, Original, 17.5-Ounce (496g) Boxes (Pack of 4), by Kellogg's.
Why Amazon has this cereal listed as ""by Smart Start"", I don't know. It is made by, and distributed by, Kellogg's Sales Company. And now on to the cereal itself. It consists of flakes of combined wheat, rice, and oats. It is crunchy and chewy, and stands up to milk quite well without becoming soggy. It has 100% PDV on many vitamins and minerals, but only a minimal or none PDV for Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, and Vitamin D, so it is not a substitute for a daily vitamin pill with minerals. The sugar content is very high at 14g per serving, about twice what most other cereals contain, and the salt content is above average at 210mg per serving. The plusses are taste, vitamin content, and texture. The minuses are too much sugar and salt. Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt. Sugar is addictive, and it leads unsuspecting children into developing hyperactivity, rotten teeth, and Diabetes. The excessive amount of salt contributes to developing high blood pressure. Overall, I would have to give this good tasting cereal an Amazon rating of four stars.

"This juice drink has a refreshing taste, but I have decided not to use it again because of the presence in the list of ingredients of high fructose corn syrup.  This substance is appearing in many of our products recently, despite the research by several universities that prove its long term ingestion is not healthy...There seems no good reason to me for the continued widespread use of this sweetener, since there is a plentiful supply of pure cane sugar to sweeten our natural fruit and other juices.

This product is on my Do Not Buy Again list even though I have always had respect for the V-8 brand of juice drinks.

"I bought these from Pep Boys because they had a 25% off sale and the ""16,000 pound"" models were $44 with tax. I picked them up locally. I did a lot of research on various ramps but looked at the smaller Rhino ramp reviews on Amazon, not the reviews for the larger ""16,000 pound"" set. The photos supplied by some Amazon customers of the Rhino ramps basically collapsing under load have me strongly considering returning them before I ever use them.

The stated ""16,000 pound"" load rating is very deceptive. On the bottom of each ramp, the following weight ratings are stamped:
""Do Not Exceed Rated Capacity of 4,000 pounds each, 8,000 pounds per pair or 16,000 pounds gross vehicle weight""
They are NOT rated for 16,000 pounds each or as a pair. I attached a photo of these ratings and the made in USA data but they might be hard to read.

The ramps are made in the USA and I saw some chatter about filling the ramps with poly foam to stiffen them up and stabilize them I think Rhino Ramps should be doing that, not forcing customers to do after market modifications to avoid injury. More to come when I decide whether or not to keep these particular ramps.

I'm looking at Race Ramps RR-56-2 ramps but they are a LOT more money - like $200 even with the 15% coupon. But given a choice between spending another $160 for ramps or getting maimed or killed by flimsy ramps really isn't a choice.

7/12/16 update - I took these back to Pep Boys and got a refund. They would not fit under 2 of my 3 cars because they are too steep and too short to accommodate the lower front ends. Add in the potential for the ""smash factor"" and I won't miss these ramps. They might be OK for a lawn tractor or an ATV but I'm not putting a 5300 pound truck on them. I ordered 66 inch all aluminum ramps.",2.0,negative

"I don't normally write an unfavorable review because I usually check things out before I make a purchase but after many years of using this product I find it to be inferior to what drew me to it in the first place. These were once good tissues but are now just expensive snot rags. These are not the old Kleenex and when they say things like Rely on durable, 2-ply thickness paper tissue sheets & Absorbent, disposable facial tissues lock in moisture its time for a reality check. The old 2-plys were much thicker & more absorbent and you could blow your nose, stick it in a pocket and itd be good to go for another use. One good blow into these and its a wet ball that stays wet while soaking pretty much the whole tissue. Im an average guy about 63 and 210-pounds and when my nose runs these are often good only for a single use but with a few blows they most often have to be tossed. Stick one in my pocket and itll be a solid wad when I pull it out. Ive even had to wash my hands because Im all wet with a single use. My wife is petite and has the same issues with these. I don't have any serious allergies or sinus problems but some mornings itll take 3-tissues to start breathing normally. If you're over 40 you know what I mean about the quality and thickness. Is it healthy to carry around a used tissue... probably not, but I don't care based on what these now cost. I find a paper towel just purchased a case of Sparkle to be much more effective and practical for me they're harsher but I get a lot of mileage for less expense. I think these are now about the equivalent of using the 1000-sheet Scott bathroom tissue on your nose so, perhaps, tissue now defines both products equally and you don't need to call them facial or bathroom. Since many used tissues likely go down the toilet we burn ours they have probably been thinned down to be more sewer system friendly. After complaining about them I will say they are much better than the off brands in the stores that have more per box and more economical than many of the brand names that offer fewer tissues per box. However, the deal of the day at the grocery store will be the way to go because paying a premium for these is just a waste on money. I went with 3-stars because the downsizing and thinning of products is growing tiresome like a 9-ounce potato chip bag that is labeled Family Size so end of rant.",2.0,negative

"This review is from: Progresso Rich & Hearty Soup, Chicken Pot Pie Style, 18.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) (Grocery)
I take one star off of this soup only because the calories are higher than I like to see in a bowl of soup. This is 150 calories per serving, and I prefer the calories to be closer to 100. Of course this isn't advertised as a light soup either. My wife recently tried combining a can of this with a can of the Light Chicken and Dumpling. The result was a pleasing lunch at an average of only 115 calories per bowl.

There is no question that this is a good tasting soup. We used to be strictly Campbell's customers, but discovered many Progresso soups earlier this year as we explored alternatives which would complement our new style of eating (losing weight instead of gaining weight! LOL). To our delight we found, on average, Progresso soups seem to be lower calorie, lower sodium, and better flavored than Campbells. There are a couple of Campbell's that we still like better (New England Clam Chowder, for example) but other than just a few exceptions Progresso has the bulk of our soup business now.

Sadly, Amazon has recently raised their prices on all Progresso soups. Last summer and fall they were considerably more cost effective to buy 12 at a time on Amazon. Now the Amazon prices are quite similar to the prices at the upscale super-market we patronize. Even the Subscribe and Save prices are not currently much of a deal compared to buying locally, and locally we don't have to buy a case at a time. Be sure to compare your local prices to these prices before you order here. Also, make sure you are getting free shipping or you will pay more. Finally, be very wary of buying food products from Amazon Resellers. Their prices are normally extremely high compared to local markets, plus they will always have shipping added.",4.0,positive

For Pecans there have been an average of 8-10 halves per can. Cashews have a bit more, maybe around 20 of them per can.

Overall the nuts have a good flavor. A lot of the almonds are toasted well, and the flavor really comes through. Just don't buy these cans unless you are fine getting mostly Peanuts and Almonds. Picking out a Cashew or Pecan is a pleasant surprise, not a regular occurrence. And if you manage to find a Brazil nut it's like finding one of Wonka's Golden Tickets.",2.0,negative

"I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.

As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.

Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.

Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""",5.0,positive

"WE love love love the Viva paper towel on the rolls.  However, the Viva Pop-ups Paper Towel Dispenser is. frrankly. awful.  The paper towel is basically insignificant, almost not there.  It's okay as a true FINGERTIP towel, because that's pretty much all three sheets can manage.  Since the towel is soft and clingy, it doesn't come out as easily as I would have hoped, so one has to pull at it, to get it out, at least when the box is full.  One of my kids compared to it to our one ply toilet paper, if that's any help.  I'm very disappointed in these cut sheets.  I would never recommend them to anyone for anything, and would never buy them again.  There's not really even good enough for wiping up tiny spills.  Stay away.  What a waste of money.

"This vacuum has two strikes against it:

* Bags: Vacuum bags are a hassle. They're a bummer to change and it's a drag trying to find replacements that work with your unit. To me, bags are a throwback to bygone days. While there are a lot of things that I loved about the simplicity of yesteryear, I won't ever forget how much vacuum bags suck.

* Canister: Canister vacuums take two hands to operate. This feels so unnecessary to me, especially since good upright vacuums are so ubiquitous. Using a canister vac seems like an additional step backwards.

If you can look past the bags and the canister style, this is an OK vacuum. It has decent sucking power and the wand is handy enough. The one great thing about the wand over an upright is that the wand is already in your hand, so there really isn't any excuse to poke the wand down in the couch cushions and suck out the couch-crumblies that our kids and dirty visitors seem to leave behind.

This vacuum truly isn't even close to my favorite, but it's a decent device for limited budgets and small floor plans. Just remember to stock up on replacement bags before the holidays, because the bags are really only good for one Christmas tree's worth of needles.",2.0,negative

"All of the translucent Solutech PLA filament colors that I have tried (Blue, Red, Clear) were brittle. They also contained an excessive number of air bubbles. On prints with lots of retractions in a small area (aka: prints with multiple small islands), the extruder drive gear frequently grinds through the filament. This leads to failed prints. This sucks. It is possible to down-grade retraction settings and prevent this. However, diminished retraction settings lead to stringing. Therefore, this filament leaves me stuck between a rock (stringing) and a hard place (grinding). It's not worth the trouble. That said, Solutech opaque colors seem to be OK. Colors are vibrant, but filament diameter variation is frequently greater than the stated +/- .03.",2.0,negative

"If you know what bucatini is, then this is good bucatini pasta.

If you are unfamiliar with bucatini, this is FAT spaghetti with a really thin needle sized hole through the strand of ""spaghetti"".

However, your diners will like this BETTER than spaghetti if they have the patience to cut the past before putting it on the fork.  It holds sauce well, feels substantial, and is just plain more interesting than spaghetti.

"I purchased these because I was having one of those couple of weeks.  My son was sick, couldn't make it into Costco (where I normally buy paper towels).  Then the AC died, and we had repair dudes in, who were awesome, but in the stress of making sure our son didn't make it out the front door I forgot to put paper towels on the list.  Twice.  And I didn't want to keep sending my husband back out, so I ordered these.  And I've got to say, I'm probably never going to do it again, but I can survive it until they are all used up.

First thing you notice when you pull these out of the box is that they are much fuzzier then most brands of paper towels.  I have attached a picture.  It's kind of like felt.  So, this is not desirable, from my perspective, if you are microwaving anything that you would use the paper towel over and don't want fibers stuck to it.  Or drying off an apple that you washed and again, don't want fibers stuck to it.

Next thing is that they tear super, super easy.  Not just when wet.  It tore two holes in the first roll I used just sliding it on our paper towel holder (it brushed up against the shorter bar of it), and this is not normally a problem I have, not with any other brand I've used.  It also comes apart easier when you are wiping up spills, which also isn't something I personally find desirable.  I need my paper towels to hold up to a lot because I am swimming in a constant sea of messes over here.  I have a very naughty kitty who's decided peeing and pooping outside of the litterbox is the world's best form of protest, his sometimes equally naughty feline sidekick, and a son who is a joy but loves to play in the sink and spill things all over pretty much everything.  So my paper towels need to not fall apart, because I use them a lot...and some of it, I don't want my fingers to come into contact with.  It's not quite as bad as toilet paper when it gets wet, but honestly, that's what it reminded me most of the way it started to come apart and turn to mush.

So, heads up. This was my experience with these in our household.",2.0,negative

"I'd be very careful with wiring this thing up for anything with significant load.  I've just had 2 ordered for a project involving commercial motorized door locks running off 24VDC.  I got them in my hands today.  First, the wire that comes off of it was missing some set screws from the factory, so I could not use the terminal.  OK, no biggie, I can use crimp connectors or whatnot.  But then I got looking at the wire lead itself.  It is no bigger than 22AWG.  So I got out my screwdriver and pulled up the terminal strip itself to see what was connecting everything.  The wire connecting each terminal is no bigger than 24AWG.  I based this off of solid core network cable.  Since I was going to use this in a commercial environment, I soldered in a reinforcing backbone of 18AWG wire which I know will beef it up a bit.  If I had known I would need to do this, I would have looked elsewhere for something properly build and rated for more draw.

"This filament has been driving me nuts. I've been attempting some 10 hour prints after doing some 10+ hour prints successfully with no issues with 3D Solutech's black and white PLA filament. I've had to restart three 10 hour prints after the filament has snagged; it turns out that this filament is not completely 1.75mm through out it's whole length and that's been the issue for the filament. I'll be unwinding the whole spool and checking the diameter for consistency as it definitely has spots that are much larger than 1.75mm and has repeatedly clogged my printer. I like the color, but what use is the spool if I cannot use it for the prints for which I purchased it.",1.0,negative

"Wow, this purchase was disappointing on every level. The ginger flavor is weak with no zing, and seems almost watered down. Additionally, the inclusion of sucralose (Splenda) in a non-diet labeled soda is an unwelcome discovery. And, rightly or wrongly, I feel a lingering annoyance at the lack of forthrightness.

Stating 25% less calories on the box does not automatically indicate the use of an artificial sweetener. Seagrams shares the name with a line of liquor so I hoped the soda would simply be a little less syrupy sweet, with a flavor perhaps a bit more grown-up -- but not diet.

Usually the packaging boldly states Diet or Ten or some other indication of an artificially sweetened product. It is common for people to have sensitivities to sucralose or simply wish to avoid it so what is the reasoning for mentioning its inclusion only in the ingredient listing?

Reading the ingredient label searching for diet ingredients in non-diet soda is not normally a part of a soft drink purchase but I guess Ill be checking from now on. So, between the diluted taste and the buried Splenda, Ill stick with Canada Dry or TJs in the future. Both of the other brands have a much more pronounced ginger bite to their flavor.",1.0,negative
"So I buy the 5 foot high lift jack. And of course I want the accessories, so I bought this wonderful item to give it a larger footprint. The picture shows it attached to the Jack neatly and they actually brag about it by including it in bold print!

When it arrives, there's a big wraparound cardboard piece that Says ""A center hole is drilled through the platform so that you can attach it to the Jack!!!""  And they show a big color picture that covers the vast majority of this cardboard insert around the Jack because they are proud of this. Then in small print, it says ""hardware not included...""

You have got to be kidding me? Are you serious? What is this hardware we speak of? A 24 karat gold nugget? Made out of diamonds perhaps? Maybe platinum? No no no, it's a simple $1 BOLT AND WING NUT. That's right ladies and gentlemen, they were too cheap to supply a stupid little small bolt and wing nut to attach it to the stand!!!

Just utterly ridiculous and being cheap beyond my comprehension. Nuts and bolts in our days cost what? $.50? You mean to tell me you can't supply a stinking little bolt with a wing nut?

"I ordered three of these since I needed something 10gallon size.  I'm barely willing to keep them since they actually do hold what I need to put in them.  I expected the commercial grade brute cans, even the 10 gallon, to be stronger than this.  The plastic is thin, and the can is easily deformed.  Amazon screwed up as well, since the box they packed them in was too shallow, and the rims were compressed out of round.  Sitting empty for two days, they didn't return to round, I had to press them back into shape.  Pretty pathetic considering I have several other old rubbermaid trashcans that hold their shape no matter what you do to them.  And when the lids finally arrived, they don't even fit well.  Sure they cover the can, and yes, they 'lock' into place below the handles.  But the rest of the lid is loose, and not even down tight to completely close the can.  Commercial? food grade?  They can only be refering to the formula for the plastic, since the construction itself is barely acceptable for general use.

If you want to keep things out of the can, you'll have to put a weight on the lid, forget trying to seal it.",2.0,negative

"This Dyson DC50 Compact is a major disappointment to me after owning and using the DC14 since 2006.  I know it's a Compact model, but it just looks and feels cheap to me and it's difficult to keep in the upright position and a pain to use the hose - no, I don't like it at all.  Well, one positive thing, it does have great suction, but it's still not the quality of the DC14 which I loved and after having some repair work done to it, it never worked as well so I replaced it with this DC50 - I needed the lightweight, but this thing is more trouble than convenient.  Now, this is just my opinion. If i could still return it I would............

I'll do some budgeting in the next months and get a larger Dyson because it still is my favorite vacuum, just not this DC50.

"From the very beginning, there were red flags. I did not go into this expecting some amazing printer, or something that would make things that look like they were injection molded. But I was still incredibly disappointed, frustrated, and angry. Some of the parts were not the correct size. Rods didn't fit into the bearings, holes were not drilled with the proper alignment, a linear bearing even had its bearings falling out. They sent me a couple new rods and bearings, but even the replacements didn't roll smoothly and stuck a lot. I didn't feel like wasting more time with getting yet another replacement.
The mdf material this is made of cracked in several places during assembly, since the 'laser cut' (apparently not precision cut) pieces didn't quite line up. After a few replacement pieces, and finally completing the build, the first big problem was the X gantry sags. A LOT. As the print head moves around, the right side raises and lows, since it has no support. It sags so much, that I was unable to fully compensate for it even with totally raising one side of the bed and completely lowering the other. I did eventually purchase the heated bed from QUBD, hoping that would help some of the other issues it was having, but it didn't. They actually didn't even send me all of the parts that were supposed to come with the heated bed, and the bed has a crack in it, and after 6 days, I still have no response from them.
But back to this travesty of a printer. As the gantry sags, you can see the top support sway, which throws it off even more. No matter how tight the screws are, there always seems to be play in the parts.
The software that was loaded onto it when I received it did not work properly, and had the X and Y axises mirrored, and one of the motors had different colored wiring than the others, adding to the confusion of building, since this is the 'new' version, which apparently has very little support out there and the instructions had several spots that did not match the parts in the kit. I tried flashing the marlin firmware, and eventually found a firmware on the qubd site that did get it to actually print, in that it would move in approximately the appropriate motions, but still with all sorts of errors.
The Y belt is never able to get quite tight enough, without modification of the pieces that hold it, so as it prints, it introduces more and more shifting in the Y direction.
The X motor has always made a sort of grinding noise, and jumps a lot when making small movements, the extruder gear is not actually round (or the hole is drilled off-center) causing the filament to either not have enough tension to be pushed through, or too much tension and it tears it up or skips back, with every revolution.
The Z motor is now skipping any time it moves more than one or two steps, and just lightly hums, so when the extruder is lifted to heat up, then goes down to start a print, it has to be manually moved back down to the correct location.
The bed (non-heated) is not actually flat. It seemed to have a bulge in one spot, slightly off center, and no matter how often I leveled it, it would not allow me to use the full size of the bed without print errors.
I have spent a month looking on forums, getting advice, and even had someone with much more 3d printing experience come over, but all to no avail.
If the print speed is anything about around 20mm/s, I don't even get something that will resemble the model, and even with it going slow, the extrusion rate has to be cranked way up, which causes all sorts of deformations.
The extruder PEEK (the cylinder insulator that basically holds the extruder to the carriage) has never fit properly into the 'mounting' and generally sits about 2-3 degrees off of vertical, causing smears and eventually ruining the layers. I have rebuilt this thing 5 times so far, and the extruder at best sits off-kilter, and generally shakes itself loose and will actually wobble around as it moves.
Anything that is printed higher than about 5-7 layers starts gettings holes, spirals, gaps, missing layers, etc.
This has been a nearly wasted month. I say nearly, because I did learn that I will not use a printer with a single z motor, made from mdf, or that is the 'cheapest'. I just hope that I can get my return approved, I would even settle for Amazon credit at this point.",1.0,negative

This toothpaste has a fresh taste. It's not exactly what I expected but does leave my breath fresh. It cleans my teeth well and appears to be fairly gentle. I have sensitive teeth and generally use toothpastes made for that issue but I bought this for the family and used it several times. It seemed fine to me. My son hated it. He said it tasted awful and didn't whiten his teeth like Crest or other super whitening toothpastes. I use activated charcoal to remove stains and whiten my teeth so I wasn't that worried about whether this paste would get my teeth sparking white. I just wanted a fresh mouth and well maintained teeth and this paste seems to do the job well enough. I prefer other brands for taste and formula but this one seems to do a good job and is often cheaper than other pastes of the same size.,4.0,positive

"Good quality filament for a great price.  Using this on my Proforge with a 0.4mm nozzle printing in 0.2mm layers and the results are really quite good.

UPDATE:  So, the quality of prints with this filament are very good.  However, I had TONS of problems with the spool.  Catches were a regular occurrence, and with a Bowden feed, this can be a problem.  They self-corrected a few times, but I also had to run over to the printer and fix the catch many, many times.  A couple of times small prints failed because of this (led to ""air printing"" where nothing was being fed).

The worst was about 80% through the roll, the filament was completely tangled; not caught, but looped around itself.  It failed 20 hours into a 28 hour print.  So, I probably lost a decent amount of the roll and a whole lot of time.  So far I like the quality of the actual filament from Hatchbox (this wasn't my only roll), but the other roll has also had a lot of catches.  If I find that it is looped on itself somewhere, both items will probably end up with a 1-star rating.  Doesn't matter how nice a good print feels when you have failed prints due to poor QA/QC.",2.0,negative

"I hate to say this, but I ate 1.5 of these tonite (they're quite small) and it did not (is still not) sitting well with me.

Maybe I'm stupid, but I associate Velveeta with yellow, cheddar-like cheese, but the sauce in the packets of these was pretty much white (not pure, but not beige).  The taste by itself was totally bland, no real cheese flavor.

Despite BOTH having exactly 3 small pieces of green pepper, it was overwhelmingly green pepper flavor. (there were a couple red pepper pieces, too, but no flavor from them).

I currently have rather bad heartburn (I do not normally have problems with that), I've already been unwell once from one end and the other end hasn't decided yet.

I do not have a delicate stomach - I am allergic to citrus but I wouldn't expect it to be an issue with lasagna, and even so, I do not feel short of breath as I would normally be had it been a citrus issue - I just feel sick to my stomach.

"I really wanted to like this product ... I really did. But my mouth never really felt clean after using it. I'm sure my teeth / mouth **were** clean, because I kept brushing and brushing to try to get that ""clean"" feeling -- but that clean feeling never came.

Second, while considering the overall product, I also didn't care for the tube design.  Most toothpaste tubes will compress and stay compressed as you use the product. However, this tube is made of a thick plastic that returns to its normal shape after you squeeze out what you want. My question: For what purpose?  It might make for a standardized appearance and look nicer on a bathroom counter (and therefore also serve as an ongoing advertisement for the company), but for practical purposes it's hard to tell when the tube is running low, and it becomes more difficult to squeeze out product as you go.

Third, the product smells just like Pepto-Bismal ... not exactly a smell I want to experience when starting my day.

Even though I didn't like this toothpaste after the first week, out of fairness I forced myself to keep with it for a few more weeks, thinking maybe it would grow on me.  It didn't.  I realize other folks enjoy this product, but I'm rating it as ""blech"" and giving it one star.",1.0,negative
"Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: ""You can work with me!""  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM.

"When I first tried this scanner I thought Wow! The miracles of modern science.  It was right on, but it was all downhill from there. I re-read the manual, watched the videos, re-set the scanner to factory default.

  I built the wall so I know exactly what is behind it. Each scan was different. One scan showed PVC pipes which I finally realized was actually a mirror on the other side of the wall in the other room.  Live wires showed up where there were none.

There is a re-set button on the back. Big woop!  Just the S.O.S.  It isn't identified.  If you look on the back of the unit, where the warning label is, there is a circle by the French words certaines identifier.  You use something like a straightened paper clip to stick in this hole to re-set the scanner. That didn't get me much. The scanner started reading no contact with wall although all wheels were right on the wall where they had been for many scans before. I-800-4-DeWalt techs were unable to help. They referred  me to a number for manufacturer, repair, parts. THEY only had the manual not an actual scanner to look at. (sighwiping away tears of frustration).

The ingredients are simple:  water, vinegar, mustard seed salt, white wine, fruit pectin, citric acid, tartaric acid, sugar, spice.  The flavor is wonderful.

As squeeze bottles of condiments go, this one is relatively small, about 1.5 times the size of a regular-size jar.

I do not know about the hygrometer; but, if the reading were important to me, I would also check it against other reliable sources.

"Update: The product listing on Amazon has been updated since I originally posted this review. The new product listing has, fortunately, removed the prior inaccurate information about this device being for use with checking salinity in addition to temperature and TDS, etc. In the old listing, it was marketed as a TDS device that could also check salinity in and of itself and on various salinity scales. My original review is below in case the product listing changes again.

*** Original review: ***

I do not recommend this unit if you plan to use it to check salinity in a salt water tank. The product page here on Amazon lists that it is for checking salinity in addition to TDS, temperature, etc. If it doesn't do that (and it doesn't), it should say that.

I purchased one of these to use for my reef aquarium. The product insert says it can be used for reef aquariums and provides instructions for that purpose (two suggested scales). The outside of the box also says that it is for aquarium and aquaculture use. However, my unit was not able to read salinity on either recommended scale; the device simply stated the parameters were out of range and displayed no reading. I tested my water with another salinity-measuring device and also calculated the salinity by hand, and the water was within standard reef parameters according to both calculations. However, the HM Digital I received could not read within that range.

I tested the device in other solutions as well with varying levels of salt and it was able to pick up a reading for lower levels of salinity. However, it could not pick up a reading for salinity in a standard salt water tank range even when the salt water was not mixed in with the tank (and thus had not been dosed with anything). The HM Digital did, however, consistently read temperature in all samples I tested.

Otherwise, the device was easy to use. It is easy to switch modes and was great for reading temperature; but it's a rather expensive for just temperature use.

There might be a simple explanation for this, or I might have received a bad unit, but when I contacted the company, they ignored my email. I am returning the item through the seller, who has been helpful. I wanted to love this item, but unfortunately, I recommend that you just buy a hydrometer or an actual refractometer for salt water use.",2.0,negative

"So, I admit this sucks up lots of dust in the carpet. I went over it when it was 'cleaned' by my shark vacuum and got up so much more. However, I accidentally sucked up a sock that was under the edge of the couch (I didn't see it and it wasn't a problem with the Shark) and it broke part of the sole plate on the vacuum. Its possible that was broken when I bought it since i bought a Amazon warehouse deal. I admit I didn't look at the bottom of the vacuum before I tried it and the sock was sucked up within a few minutes of vacuuming. So, the vacuum sounds insane now and its super loud and crazy. I really regret buying this. My shark vacuum has lasted almost 2 years now and I have even sucked up more than one sock that went all the way into the dirt canister and I saved later.

I wanted a second vacuum so I could have one on each floor in my home and this was a best seller and half the price of another shark. Worst decision ever. A replacement part is $11, but shipping for that part is like $8 and will take maybe 2 weeks. All for 10 minutes of vacuuming? If this keeps up it will cost the same as the double the price vacuum in the matter of a couple of months. Terrible, terrible product. The worst is that I can't tell if it was literally from sucking up one sock in the vacuum or if it was damaged and getting the sock in there knocked the broke part loose.",1.0,negative

That was an incorrect assumption. It's also thin and runny and kind of soaks into your toothbrush, instead of sitting on top of it. The consistency grossed my husband out and I don't think he'll be using it again.

"I've tried several different brands of instant mashed potatoes over the years, and found none of them to be that great.  I mean, they were an OK substitute when I didn't want to go to the trouble to make homemade mashed potatoes, but they weren't very satisfying, either.  I'd come to the conclusion that no one could make really good instant mashed potatoes -- something about the processing required, etc.

Well, I've changed my mind.  These Butter Golden Selects are the BEST instant mashed potatoes I've tried, and they're actually better than a lot of homemade mashed potatoes I've had, too.  Each packet makes two generous servings, and they are truly ""instant"" mashed potatoes.  Just add the packet to 2 cups of boiling water, stir, cover, let stand for 5 minutes, fluff with a fork, and you'll have amazingly good slightly ""chunky"" mashed potatoes.

I've made homemade mashed potatoes with Yukon Gold potatoes -- that's what these taste like.  Rich potato flavor with just a hint of butteriness.  I love that there are some small ""chunks"" of potato in the mix -- really makes them ""feel"" more like homemade.

I'm totally sold on these.  I may never make homemade mashed potatoes again.  They're really that good!",5.0,positive

"Dowel joinery offers two key features. (1) Registration so edges of adjoining sections align, and (2) Strengthens the joinery PROVIDED the dowels are a firm fit.

THESE DOWELS are on AVERAGE 0.486 inch.  Therefore, registration can be in error by as much as 0.007"" on average and as far as strength goes, these dowels will be floating in glue rather than being affixed firmly to wood WITH Glue.  Too sloppy of a fit!  They are slotted so no allowance for glue squeeze out is necessary.  The ridges on the flutes form the firm fit to the hole ID while the grooves provide channels for glue to flow and form good bond between dowel and wood.  THESE DOWELS ARE TERRIBLE.

"I give this high quality product a FIVE STAR RATING.  The items I've bought from this company are fine quality, well packaged, at a good price.

The low rating is for AMAZON-

RE  the product:

HOW are you going to use it?  And, do you REALLY know what you're buying?

I was planning to make a 12"" round sieve.  For my purpose (sieving dry powdered clay) it would have worked IF I had bought the right product.

RE  Amazon's poor descriptions of technical items:

After I saw that I had ordered the wrong item, I called two companies that market sieves.  They said ""You need to consider the thickness of the wire (which affects the durability for your use, and the size of the openings), the size of the openings per square inch, and the amount of openings per square inch.  Then there's the ""Sieve Number""...

OK, so now, I'll just call Amazon's supplier, so I can buy the correct item next time.

Amazon said ""Call our company 'Small Parts', they sell this.""  But 'Small Parts' DOES NOT SELL THIS ITEM, THUS, THERE IS NO WAY I CAN GET MORE INFORMATION.

Yes Amazon, I know that selling many items means knowing the details of those items, BUT YOUR DESCRIPTIONS ARE OFTEN INADEQUATE.  Time is Money! I'm bringing you business, this should be a very simple matter to put more details in your ""Product Descriptions.""  YOU are the MARKET for your suppliers: you can simply demand that THEY list a TRUE & FULL DESCRIPTION.  This is not hard.

I'VE HAD TO CALL YOU NUMEROUS TIMES TRYING TO GET MORE DETAILED INFORMATION on the technical things I buy. YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE DO A GOOD JOB, BUT YOU DO NOT SUPPLY THEM ENOUGH INFORMATION YOUR CUSTOMERS MIGHT NEED.

"I bought the earlier version of this vacuum.  At first I loved it, but soon learned to hate it.  The one huge failing of this vacuum is a single filter that clogs with particulate matter such as cement dust off a garage floor.  It can happen in as little as vacuuming the garage once.  The filter is located inside the top of the collection bucket and it's spring loaded.  Removing it from the dusty bucket area results in fine dust getting shot everywhere when the spring pops back open.  Touching any part of the collection area makes any caught dust fall out onto the floor since you have now removed the bucket.  After you clean the filter, you have a giant mess of fine dust to vacuum up, re-clogging the filter.  I had to resort to removing the entire vacuum off the wall each time the filter needed cleaning and taking it outside.  Imagine doing this for every 10-15 minutes of operation.  Replacing the filter with a new one doesn't help the situation any.  I considered removing the filter entirely and venting the vacuum outside, but that would subject the motor to all the dust, probably killing it.

After dealing with this aggravation for several years I finally found a decent wall mount vacuum that takes bags and bought a VacuMaid GV50PRO.  Twice the price and louder, but I don't have to clean a filter out every 10 minutes of use.

If you never vacuum floors, drywall dust or other finer particulates the vacuum is great, but as a general shop vac it sucks.",2.0,negative

"Sorry ... really don't like leaving unpleasant reviews.  But first all: Seller is honorable, responsive, and made good on refund of pump. In summary: Quite dissatisfied with pump.  Ad did not have sufficient information such as inlet / outlet size.  Turns out these are 1/2"" and need to be adapted to various pipe thread sizes. Had to go to RV store to find adapters with cone inserts to seal from leaking. Threads on pump are plastic ... not stainless as description partially indicates under material.  Worst part is diaphragm pump internal check valve did not initially function properly and caused excessive pulsing and pipe vibrations that triggered sever pressure gauge needle gyrations. Blurred so bad with pump action that could not read.  After starting and stopping pump several times, it settled down some but rattles the pipe with pulsing. Subsequent to trying to determine what in the world was going on ... learned that there are noise cancelling hoses that can be used and perhaps an accumulator installed to mitigate pulsing. (Thus manufacturer is aware of issues). Cost of these added items doubles pump project costs.  Plus internal 'check valve' fail would require an external one. Pump did make pressure to about 45 psi, however, the automatic shut - off was not a clean shut - off. Motor slowed down and made sputtering sound prior to finally turning off.  (Perhaps switch arcing inside, I don't know, but didn't sound right.)  Overall,  due to above deficiencies, questionable reliability, and poor product information, pump was returned for refund ... which I received.",1.0,negative

"I've used several different carpet cleaners over the years, some I've rented, some I've purchased. After renting a carpet cleaner a few times it became obvious that for only a bit more than a rental, I could own a cleaner rather than have to rent one that has to be returned quickly. That's when I invested in my first Hoover carpet cleaner. I bought it used and I don't remember the model number. Although used, the carpet cleaner worked extremely well and I was very pleased with it. There was only one problem with it - the previous owner had broken the upholstery wand and I really wanted to be able to do my upholstery.

So I gave that used one to a friend and bought a brand new one from Amazon - the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoover-SteamVac-Carpet-Cleaner-with-Clean-Surge-F5914-900/dp/B00009R66F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900</a>. This one was fantastic! Everything worked well on it, including the upholstery wand.

A bit later, I received a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BISSELL-Big-Green-Deep-Cleaning-Machine-Professional-Grade-Carpet-Cleaner-86T3/dp/B00450U6CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BISSELL Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine Professional Grade Carpet Cleaner, 86T3</a>&nbsp;to review. This cleaner was also fantastic, although not cut out for small living areas due to its bulky size. However, that same large size meant I could clean a larger area in a shorter period of time, which was very nice.

When I found the Hoover MaxExtract77 Multi-Surface Pro Carpet & Hard Floor Cleaner FH50240, I was sold. The one thing all of the other carpet cleaners I had were missing was a hard floor cleaning feature. I had purchased a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-905-1-500-Watt-On-Demand-Power-Steamer-and-Cleaner/dp/B000I618NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner 905 1,500-Watt On-Demand Power Steamer and Cleaner</a>&nbsp;to steam my floors and it works very well, but I thought having one machine to do both hard floors and carpeted areas would be perfect.

Unfortunately, the MaxExtract77 doesn't live up to the quality I've previously experienced with the Hoover brand, both in carpet cleaners and vacuums. From the moment I started assembling this unit, I knew it was bad. I've assembled two carpet cleaners and three vacuums by myself over the years without a problem. The MaxExtract77 I received was very obviously defective. I screwed the top handle into the base without issue. Then I tried to add the water tanks. The bottom tank for dirty water fit fine. The top tank that holds the solution was a different story altogether. It was impossible to latch it into the cleaner and I almost hurt myself trying to. Impossible, that is, until I removed the screw securing the top handle in the base. With the screw removed, I could get the top tank to latch if I pushed it with a lot of weight behind it. The trouble is, this pushed the screw holes on the top handle and base out of alignment so the screw could no longer be inserted at all. Not good.

I finally gave up and called Hoover customer service, where I received an agent who introduced herself as Mona Lisa. This agent was not very helpful, didn't seem to know what to do or how to handle a situation like this and finally promised to have a supervisor call me to see if they could help better. That was April 24, 2012. It is now July 4, 2012 and I still have not received that return call. After waiting fruitlessly for that call, I finally called the customer service line again. This time I was aided by Ian, who was actually extremely professional and helpful. He agreed to send replacement parts for the top tank and the top handle in the hopes that these new parts might be made a bit better. Ian went out of his way to make this exchange as convenient as possible for me, even sending a shipping label so I could send the defective parts back.

The new parts arrived the next week. While they work a little better, they are still not good. I can now secure the handle with the screw AND put the top tank in, but again I have to push the top tank in with a lot of weight behind it to make it fit.

Although I had no confidence in this machine, I tried cleaning my carpets with it. One thing I do like is that the solution reservoir has separate compartments for clean water and the solution. This allows you to use a Rinse feature on the machine if you like.

The MaxExtract77 is close to the same size that my old Hoover was, but I found it much more difficult to push over the floors than the old one. In fact, my Bissell is much larger than the MaxExtract77 and the Bissell is easier to push. When I finished cleaning all the floors in my home and the upholstery in my car, my arm ached from the wrist all the way to the shoulder blade. I wasn't able to sleep on that side at all that night and the pain kept me awake until I finally put two ice packs on my arm. I've never had this issue with any other carpet cleaner.

Despite the issues with the assembly and the weight of the machine, it really did a great job on both the upholstery in my car and my carpet. I bought my car used and have never cleaned the upholstery before. Someone evidently spilled dark soft drinks in various locations because after I sprayed the seats with the Hoover cleaner, large dark spots appeared where there had previously been no sign of a stain, almost as if it were invisible ink. The Hoover worked very well to remove these old stains and also some newer stains on the carpet in my house.

I then set about to clean the hard floors in my home. This feature was the main reason I wanted the MaxExtract77 and I was excited to use it. The hard floor attachment was easy to attach to the bottom and it seemed secure when I started. I was soon disappointed when that hard floor attachment fell off the unit after 2 or 3 pushes and was further frustrated when it persisted in falling off constantly. Not only that, the hard floor cleaning didn't seem to actually suck up any water and left huge puddles of water all over the kitchen and dining room floors, causing me to fall or nearly fall several times. I called it quits when the last fall hurt my tailbone pretty badly and also bruised my arm significantly. There are much easier ways to clean a hard floor without resulting in bodily injury.

One other thing to note is that the Hoover MaxExtract77 seems to run through the cleaning solution pretty quickly. It came with a 32 fluid ounce bottle of the Hoover Professional Strength 2X Concentrate for carpets and a 16 fluid ounce bottle of the hard floor cleaning detergent. The carpet cleaning concentrate ran out before I finished and I had to get some more cleaner to finish the carpets. Before I ran out, I was able to clean the upholstery in my car, the living room, two bedrooms and the hallway. I used the entire bottle of hard floor detergent to try to clean the kitchen and dining room floors. There might have been enough left in the clean water tank to do the two bathrooms since they are very small, but I gave up on hard floor cleaning before I made it to those rooms.

If the MaxExtract77 had been the first Hoover device I had ever used, I would likely never buy another of their products again. Luckily, I have had fantastic experiences with other Hoover products in the past. I do like the Hoover brand, but I would absolutely never recommend the MaxExtract77 floor cleaner to anyone. This machine is highly defective and should be scrapped. Look at other Hoover models, but do not buy this one.",1.0,negative

"The bottles appear to be of adequate quality, the droppers are more cheaply made and apparently cannot be separated from the rubber bulb/cap for sterilization/cleaning.  That's a huge problem because the company does not put them together at the time of manufacturing so as to minimize contamination of either the inside of the bottles (tops are completely open from the time of packaging through arrival to the end user, and the droppers are loose and completely separate from the bottles, allowing for individual contamination of each dropper).  Therefore, these should all be considered contaminated upon arrival because of the manufacturing process, requiring complete cleaning/sterilization before use, depending on the intended use by the end user.  For homeopathic remedies, for example, this is entirely unacceptable.  This is not just a shipping issue, they are created this way by the manufacturer",2.0,negative

"I'm baffled by the positive reviews here. I own 6 vacuums, and this is the worst one I own. I will compare this Eureka directly with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoover-Linx-Cordless-Stick-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B001PB8EJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoover Linx Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner</a>, which is the other stick vacuum I use on a daily basis.

Packaging/assembly:
It comes tightly packaged in a long, skinny box. Unpacking it once the box was opened was frustrating, as everything is encased in a plastic bag. It was easy enough to put together - one screw, pop in the suction unit (a glorified Dust Buster), and away you go. It's basically 2 vacuums in one - one is a Dust Buster, and the other is a stick vacuum with the Dust Buster built in.

Build:
100% plastic. Not a single thing feels high quality on this vacuum. Unfortunately most vacuums are pure plastic these days, but I've never seen one with more plastic than this one.

Performance:
Yikes - bad, bad, bad. We have bamboo flooring all throughout our house with area rugs. We also have 3 dogs and a cat. This vacuum pales in comparison to the Hoover Linx. You should disregard any of the reviews that state this vacuum picks up hair off of rugs - it does NOT work on rugs. I literally cannot get this vacuum to pick up anything on a rug. It has a roller brush, which does a great job of pushing hair all over the rug but not actually picking it up. The Hoover excels in this category, hands down.

As far as picking up hair on the hardwood, it does a fine job with hairballs floating on the floor. With dust, grass, cat litter...well, that's a different story. It literally picked up 25% of that stuff I tried to pick up. It has very poor suction, likely because this is a glorified dust buster, as previously mentioned.

The head on this vacuum maneuvers in a very awkward manner. It's got rubber wheels on the bottom that are quite loud on hardwood (much louder than the Hoover), and it's difficult to turn the head on a dime like the Hoover.  You can get underneath tables easily, as the head folds down nicely. The head does not lock in place when you stand this vacuum up, however. So you have to stand it up and hope it doesn't fall over on its own. Plus, when you carry this anywhere, the head just flops down because it can't lock in place. Poor design.

The Dust Buster part is the dirt receptacle. It doesn't hold much, and is kind of a pain to empty (you have to take out the filter, dump upside down, the fit it all back together). With the Hoover, you press a button and all the contents fall out and you close the lid (plus the container is about 3 times bigger).

The battery takes 16-17 hours to charge (per the instructions), and lasted for about 2 runs through my first floor. It loses some battery power about 5 minutes after a full charge. You charge the dust buster part, either attached to the vacuum or all by itself.

The dust buster by itself is handy for crumbs and spills on furniture. It does not pick up any hair whatsoever, so don't even try. It's exactly like dust busters used to be in the 80s.

Overall, this is a glorified dust buster that is trying to vacuum your floors. It simply cannot compete with more powerful stick vacuums, like the Hoover Linx. This Eureka would work well if you worked in a feather factory and that's all you had to pick up. Otherwise, you're better off looking elsewhere.

Right now on Amazon, for $40 more you can get the Hoover Linx, which works exponentially better than this Eureka. It's made of much higher quality material and actually picks up hair (both on hardwood and on rugs). I simply cannot recommend this vacuum in good conscience - there are far better options.

Pros:
detachable dust buster can be useful
spinning brush on the bottom can help to pick up balls of hair

Cons:
100% plastic
poor suction - does not pick up litter and dust very well, and does not have strong suction compared to other vacuums in the same class
does NOT work on rugs/carpet - it just spreads hair around
poor maneuverability - very awkward and LOUD
head does not lock in an upright position and flops all over the place while carrying it
cumbersome to empty the dust receptacle, and it doesn't hold much",2.0,negative

"The Good: My husband loves oatmeal, but not all the sugar that comes with the flavored varieties, so we get the plain in bulk and add what we want to it. This is very easy to cook and softens quickly on the stovetop or microwave. One order will last us daily breakfasts between 3-4 months, so we don't have to reorder often.

The Bad: Know that despite the cylinder pictured, this will come in a large box with two plastic bags inside. If you have a large containers to pour these into like we do, this won't be an issue, but I imagine it would be difficult to use straight out of the bags.

Pros:
-Tasty but filling
-Affordable
-No added sugar

Cons:
-Bulky packaging

"This gadget is not sensitive enough to be of  value.  I operate an observatory that takes geophysical measurements so I am accustomed to taking measurements of various kinds.  I have investigated the observatory thoroughly with very expensive equipment costing more than $2000 so I know where the ""gremlins"" are, and how bad they are.  I also work with a group that educates people on the health hazards of smart meters, so I was looking for a low cost product to recommend to people that can provide valid information about their home environments.

I tested this device against the pre measured  known areas in the observatory.  For household wiring, known ""dirty electricity"" areas, there was no response.  For a nearby cell phone tower, no response.  For a cell telephone on standby as well as initiating a call, no response.  Twelve inches from a running 1500 W microwave oven, no response.  The only reading that registered was about 18"" from a running motor in an air purifier.  The reading went to 0 farther away.  By comparison other measurements show that biologically active intensities exist for a six foot radius around the air purifier.

This device is not sensitive enough in frequency response or sensitivity to be of value to detect possibly biologically active signals and protect people.  There are other inexpensive devices such as the iMeshbean that work much better.

"First can I say that these bake dried snacks are not chunks. The pieces of mango are more like little flat squares that are almost totally dehydrated. They are definitely chewy treats.

I consume organic teas. Both green and black teas contain fluoride, although green tea contains twice the amount found in black. About 50 percent of fluoride (from any source) is deposited in the bone and teeth; the other half is excreted. Regardless, I get enough fluoride from my city drinking water and do not need additional fluoride or additives like Sorbital and Saccharin sweetners, SLS poison which breaks down tissue and causes cankers, Propylene Glycol an alcohol, etc...

The main ingredients in conventional toothpaste are sodium fluoride to prevent cavities and abrasives like hydrated silica for cleaning and polishing the teeth. In animal studies, sodium fluoride has been associated with both cancer and neurotoxicity. Like mouthwashes, toothpastes are generally sweetened with artificial sugars such as saccharin and sucralose, and coloured with dyes such as Blue #1 and Yellow #5. To create foam, manufacturers add sodium laurel sulfate, which may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a probable carcinogen. Propylene glycol, which can cause contact dermatitis at very low concentrations, is also a common ingredient in toothpaste. Triclosan may be added for its antibacterial properties. Triclosan is a possible endocrine disrupting chemical and has been shown in animal studies to harm the thyroid.

"De Cecco is a very good pasta. Years ago, EVERY variety of De Cecco pasta was extruded through bronze dies.  Better quality pasta makers extrude their dough through bronze dies, which require more pressure but leave microstriations that capture the sauce when the pasta is seasoned. In other words, when pasta is extruded though bronze dies, THE SAUCE STICKS TO THE PASTA BETTER!
De Cecco now only makes a few varieties that are extruded though Bronze.

In Italy, pasta is graded in three quality levels. The designations for each level are the lower case letter ""i"" as in it, if etc
 (i.) Durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semola di grano duro), (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and (iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour.

De Cecco would be the equivalent of a (ii) grade.

American pastas like Ronzoni or Barilla (Yes, the Barilla pasta you buy in the United States IS made in the US and NOT in Italy. Call the up. I did}. are made from the exact same semolina AND white flour that Ronzoni is made from. In my opinion those are the two worst brands of pasta you can buy There are hundreds of good grade Pastas from Italy. Usually in cellophane bags that are at minimum a grade (ii). The higher end ones are grade (i) which is the highest grade semolina with NO flour and extruded through bronze dies so that they are porous to HOLD the sauce.  Any time you see the word ""FLOUR"" in the ingredients, skip it. Even the WORST pastas in Italy only allow 3% flour.
One of my favorite pastas is from Cucina Antica. That pasta is POROUS, made from the best quality Italian Semolina. You can SMELL the semolina when you serve it and it will HUG THE SAUCE. Another great pasts is Divella. But be certain to choose pasta's from their bronze extruded line of  pastas.
So, as far as grocery store pasta, De Cecco is still one of the best. I'm just dissatisfied that they are now doing away with the Bronze extrusion process.
You can get the same quality as De Cecco at a lower price by buying brands like Anna or any other brand that is made in Italy and ONLY contains Durham Semolina. Once you see things like Durham FLOUR or Semolina FLOUR, skip it. It will never cook to firm consistency. It goes from too hard to too soft. Nothing in between. If you want to go HIGH end, get Cucina Antica. It's the same as the pastas that go for over ten bucks per pound.",4.0,positive

"I received this scanner today just in time to hang some shelves for my wife. In short, this does not work at all. Not at all. Thinking the problem was me, I reread the directions twice including the troubleshooting section. Then I set up an experiment. I put blue tape on the wall marking location and item this ""radar"" scanner found. I did three separate scans of the wall following horizontal routes at least two feet away from each other. Not once did any of the wooden studs it found line up. The worst scan had three studs about 4 inches apart and then a gap of about 4 feet where it found nothing was behind the wall. I then took my cheap stud finder and it found that none of the studs the radar device found matched what the stud finder did. A couple of test holes and a tape measure proved the stud finder was spot on and the radar scanner was completely wrong every time. This is a wall with nothing in it but wooden studs. Unfortunately it showed all kinds of stuff in there. Maybe it's confusing sheetrock screws with metal? Maybe the pine studs are not detectable depending on their density? I don't know. I do know, however, that this device was a complete failure and is not ready to be sold.

At first I thought my device was at fault. Then I read it seems everyone who purchased one of these is having the same difficulty. All my other portable tools are Dewalt and I'm generally very loyal to the brand. I owned one drill for 12 years that just broke last month. So I've always been impressed with their reliability.

"This is NOT a 72MHz bandwidth scope. It is rated at 72Msps or 72 mega samples per second, but it is really two 36Msps ADC channels. That is shared between the active channels, so if you have all four channels running, it is down to only 18Msps.

I gave this only 1 star because it is NOT a ""72MHz analog bandwidth"" scope. As a 4.4MHz scope, I would give it 4 stars. I'd leave off the last star because of the rotten documentation, nonstandard connectors, crappy sine wave on the built-in function generator, and difficulty in figuring out how to update the firmware.

An analog signal like a sine wave requires -at- -least- 8 samples per cycle, which puts this at about 4.5MHz with all four channels going.

This is born out by the antialiasing filters on U17 and U18 on the two analog channels which have a -3dB cutoff of about 4.4MHz. That goes for -everyone's- DSO203.

It is important to know that channels 3 and 4 are digital only. I think they accept CMOS 5V logic levels. In addition, the wrong TVS protection diodes sourced for the two digital channels, limiting the bandwidth on them to about 1MHz max. For reasonable accuracy on a digital signal, that means they are only useful to about 100kHz. This is only on channels 3 and 4.

The documentation is on SainSmart's website and is pretty good. You'll need an unpacker that supports RAR files.

As a really small ~4MHz portable oscilloscope, this is not completely horrible. It has a built-in signal generator (10Hz to 8MHz) and it can fit in your laptop bag or in a briefcase. This is an open source design, so there are a lot of custom updates to the firmware out there. The internal function generator is used to adjust x10 probe compensation, the capacitors are under the battery. You'll need a stable adjustable voltage reference source with a decent DMM to do the ""self"" calibration, up to 60V.

Unfortunately, the signal generator is really only useful for the roughest of purposes. The square wave is fine if you need it for 3.3V circuits, as it is only 3V. The sine, sawtooth, and triangle waves are horrible. They have 15 very visible, large steps, clearly only 4 bits of information. In addition, there is no level control.

This uses something called an MCX connector. It is a small push-in connector that relies on the springiness of the metal to hold it in place. A bad thing for something like a scope probe that is going to get moved around a lot. I had problems with intermittent connections. Wouldn't it have been better to use a more readily available, more reliable connector like an SMA? Small enough not to increase the size of the scope, but it screws on so it is nice and secure.

For $100 more, you can get a Hantek DSO5072P and have true 70MHz bandwidth with 1Gsps and easier to find BNC probes. It is quite a bit larger which means a nice 7"" screen, but not so portable.

I don't trust SainSmart to know proper ESD procedures, due to past experiences and emailed conversations. So if they are buying this ready-made and slapping their name on it, probably not a problem, but if they actually build it, good luck.",1.0,negative

Now I can't recommend it.  The company (XYZPrinting) has been taking active steps with their firmware and software to block people from using 3rd party filament - honestly, one of the only things that got this printer a decent following in the first place.

Given that this is the attitude of the company, I can't recommend this printer anymore.  It's built crappily and I've already had to fix several things with it, or add modifications to get decent functionality.  And since XYZ wants to discourage that, I'd say there's very little future with this machine.

"I ordered three of these since I needed something 10gallon size.  I'm barely willing to keep them since they actually do hold what I need to put in them.  I expected the commercial grade brute cans, even the 10 gallon, to be stronger than this.  The plastic is thin, and the can is easily deformed.  Amazon screwed up as well, since the box they packed them in was too shallow, and the rims were compressed out of round.  Sitting empty for two days, they didn't return to round, I had to press them back into shape.  Pretty pathetic considering I have several other old rubbermaid trashcans that hold their shape no matter what you do to them.  And when the lids finally arrived, they don't even fit well.  Sure they cover the can, and yes, they 'lock' into place below the handles.  But the rest of the lid is loose, and not even down tight to completely close the can.  Commercial? food grade?  They can only be refering to the formula for the plastic, since the construction itself is barely acceptable for general use.

If you want to keep things out of the can, you'll have to put a weight on the lid, forget trying to seal it.",2.0,negative
"The Heart Healthy Mix is overwhelmingly peanuts ... in more ways than one. I haven't picked a pinch out of the bag yet that didn't have at least one peanut in it, and the taste of the peanuts overwhelms the tastes of any other nuts ... even if I eat them separately, they still have absorbed the strong taste of the peanuts.  I like peanuts, and I like the taste of peanuts, but I do not like my pecans and pistachios, walnuts and hazelnuts, and almonds to taste like peanuts.  Nor do I like paying pecan, pistachio, walnut, hazelnut, and almond prices for peanuts.  If you don't like that also, best give the Heart Healthy Mix a miss --- try the Wholesome Nut Mix instead.",2.0,negative
"When Seventh Generation say their scented products should smell like ""Lemongrass Citrus"", it's more like Clean Well's well-known scent of thyme. I like it how it remains very moist and wet throughout the cleaning process. I feel like I am not wasting and it doesn't make my hands feel ultra dry like Clorox Green Works wipes and Lysol generic disinfecting wipes.

I have several issues with the seller's page, however... first, the ingredients aren't listed and the back of the canister is totally different from the seller's page. I took a picture of the correct one, which lists all of the inactive ingredients. Users and customers beware: Yes, this product does contain SLS's -- the company doesn't indicate that it is vegetable derived or specifies. It also doesn't say whether or not it is tested on animals or it's cruelty free. Although on both Seventh Generation and Clean Well websites, state that their ingredients are vegetarian friendly, and cruelty free.

Their inactive ingredients as follows: water, SLS, bluestone, citric acid, sodium citrate, and essential oil fragrances (origanum vulgare, cymbopogon nardus, and cymbopogon schoenanthus with citral -- a component of these essential oils).",4.0,positive

"I have had these before and I didn't like them in the past but I wanted to try them again because they were such a great deal through Amazon Prime Pantry. Unfortunately I just don't like them and can't.

This review is hard to write because there are some ""good"" things about these cookies. First of all they came packaged well. They arrived with no broken pieces and nothing looked melted when I opened it. So that part of the cookies were ""good"". I just don't like the taste of these for some reason. They don't taste like regular Chips Ahoy. I don't think it's a defective batch because like I said I've tried them before and I didn't like them then either.

So with all that being said I have to unfortunately give these cookies just a 2 star rating because I simply do not like the taste of them. Who knows though, maybe you might like them? As far as packaging and how they arrived though I'm happy about that, the taste of them makes me sad though. Might be Chips Ahoy brand but definitely does not taste like the regular ones.",2.0,negative

"About 1/3 - 1/2 of these clamps failed at the point of installation. I would turn the screw and it would tighten for a while but when I made the ""last"" turn to make it as tight as I could (where the adjusting screw doesn't turn any more), the screw would just turn freely and the pressure exerted by the clamp would disappear. I've never had a radiator clamp strip before and I'm not a super strong twister of screws. So I was pretty surprised at the rate of failure. I bought several different boxes and several different sizes and had the same general experience with all sizes and lots.

I don't know the nature of the failure. And I don't know whether the clamps that didn't strip are durably strong. But I use them mainly to connect pipe and fittings in an underground irrigation systems. So the cost of fixing a broken clamp is very high in terms of lost water, time to locate the leak, time to dig up the joint and time to redo the original job. I sympathize with the reviewer who lost an engine using these. These clamps have a low price but are very expensive in the long run.",1.0,negative

"I have been experimenting with bodywashes for a while to find the best solution for me. I don't have sensitive skin or anything but I like knowing I am not missing out on something better.

Granted, most if not all bodywashes are created with chemicals but as I stated, I have dealt with many body washes and I have to say, the scent of this one is at the bottom of the list. Another thing I realized when using this body wash is that often times, I have to go back and get more of it for the first and second scrubs of my body. I think that is from the pump feature that is has, however. It also doesn't leave a pleasant layer of lotion on the skin after use like other body washes.

"De Cecco is a very good pasta. Years ago, EVERY variety of De Cecco pasta was extruded through bronze dies.  Better quality pasta makers extrude their dough through bronze dies, which require more pressure but leave microstriations that capture the sauce when the pasta is seasoned. In other words, when pasta is extruded though bronze dies, THE SAUCE STICKS TO THE PASTA BETTER!
De Cecco now only makes a few varieties that are extruded though Bronze.

In Italy, pasta is graded in three quality levels. The designations for each level are the lower case letter ""i"" as in it, if etc
 (i.) Durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semola di grano duro), (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and (iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour.

De Cecco would be the equivalent of a (ii) grade.

American pastas like Ronzoni or Barilla (Yes, the Barilla pasta you buy in the United States IS made in the US and NOT in Italy. Call the up. I did}. are made from the exact same semolina AND white flour that Ronzoni is made from. In my opinion those are the two worst brands of pasta you can buy There are hundreds of good grade Pastas from Italy. Usually in cellophane bags that are at minimum a grade (ii). The higher end ones are grade (i) which is the highest grade semolina with NO flour and extruded through bronze dies so that they are porous to HOLD the sauce.  Any time you see the word ""FLOUR"" in the ingredients, skip it. Even the WORST pastas in Italy only allow 3% flour.
One of my favorite pastas is from Cucina Antica. That pasta is POROUS, made from the best quality Italian Semolina. You can SMELL the semolina when you serve it and it will HUG THE SAUCE. Another great pasts is Divella. But be certain to choose pasta's from their bronze extruded line of  pastas.
So, as far as grocery store pasta, De Cecco is still one of the best. I'm just dissatisfied that they are now doing away with the Bronze extrusion process.
You can get the same quality as De Cecco at a lower price by buying brands like Anna or any other brand that is made in Italy and ONLY contains Durham Semolina. Once you see things like Durham FLOUR or Semolina FLOUR, skip it. It will never cook to firm consistency. It goes from too hard to too soft. Nothing in between. If you want to go HIGH end, get Cucina Antica. It's the same as the pastas that go for over ten bucks per pound.",4.0,positive

"Well, maybe excepting the people who actually build boat anchors... for all I know they're in the same factory.

Hoo-boy.  After reading all the reviews, realizing that yes, this was probably assembled by some unfortunate future organ donor in a Laogai in mainland China, I took a chance and ordered one.  It arrived in short order, short two handles.  Looked promising though so I contacted Amazon to pick it up and go ahead and send me another which they got to me the next day.

Due to various work commitments it was a few days until I could unbox, degrease, disassemble/lube and reassemble to actually use it and in the process, having already spent about an hour doing the little bit of detail described, I discovered not only was the lower threaded rod BENT making it very difficult to bring the top half more than halfway across, one of the bolt handle BOLT threads were so badly damaged the retaining nut wouldn't thread on.

This is going back tomorrow.  I don't need another boat anchor.  Should've known better.  Am about to pull the trigger on a Grizzly G0704.  Buy once cry once.",1.0,negative

Instead of solid glue area it turns into two flimsy films. I am not sure who designed this and what they were thinking, and also not sure who reviews this with five stars...

"The picture is misleading. It shows a wheel that was machined. The actual wheel is made of sintered iron (looks like cast iron but it is easier to manufacture) and painted grey. It comes with all the pitfalls of chap casting, the major one being dimensional variability. There are more holes and smaller. The axle is bolt and nut - a plus because you can take it apart and add 10mm flat washers to stop the wheel moving from side to side. The bad part is that the wheel hole for the axle is not centered in the middle of the wheel and that the wheel hub side faces are not parallel to the wheel or to each other. So if you shim it with washers you will also have to clean the hub faces. Also the wheel hole for the axle is larger than the axle and even after shimming you will still get some side play. On the plus side is that the load is higher than the similar sized plastic wheels - the reason I bought them. You can also use more of them and mount them in a row to increase total load capacity while still maintaining maneuverability.
Unfortunately I could not find a better quality 2"" fixed wheel with same load capacity even if I wanted to pay more.",2.0,negative

"I love this printer! however it comes with its upsides  and down sides:
Pros:
-Great value!
-It comes with everything you need! screws, nuts bolts, and I still have plenty of extra parts if it needs to be repaired! It even comes with all the tools you need to do it with!
-ships quickly and is packaged very well
-Fantastic LCD screen
Cons:
-Terrible guide! the instructional video was terrible quality and had no voice over to help you along
- does take some modification/ fixing bad parts (a part of my board shorted out and I had to replace it)
- SD card doesn't work! I don't know why but whenever i put an SD card in, the printer reads ""no SD card detected""
- takes some skill and time to assemble,  ***DON'T BUY IF YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE DOING**
I am very happy with this printer, and it is well worth the cost, however I must remove a star for the terrible guide and ""instructional video""

"While this PEI surface on my printer bed is good for adhesion, I had serious problems getting this sheet to stick to either the aluminum bed or a glass plate even using 3M 468 adhesive.  The problem is that the sheet of PEI I received was warped about 1/2"" over 12 inches length.  I did not think this was a problem and mounted it, then ended up stripping and remount it several times.

That small, permanent warp in this PEI sheet caused no end of problems with it lifting off the bed at the edges.  PEI is flexible but does not conform well and tension always existed at the edges.  A flat sheet from another supplier has not had this problem.  I'm testing to see if mounting it with the warp down will work any better, but frankly don't have much hope for it.

I plan on making milkshakes  with it using xanthan gum to thicken it, splenda and coco powder to see how the combination comes out..the calories should still remain at 30 per 8 oz's..that's amazing.

"Update #5
After trying get support from XYZprinting, they refused to honor my warranty.  At this point, the printer is paper-weight. The hardware is decent so I've decided to swap the control board with Arudino & Ramp 4.1.  Wish I've gone with another printer. But will have to make lemonade with with lemon I guess.  If you intend on getting Da Vinci, get the cheaper 1.0A and NOT this 2.0A.

Update #4:
After nearly a 9 months of usage, left extruder stopped, then filament gear stopped working. It's become an expensive paper weight in office.  Their XYZprinting support is terrible.  Regret in this purchase.

Update #3:
Found this CALIBRATION PROCEDURE works best with less calibrations need between prints:
Start a demo print. As soon as it warms up and begins to print, watch  extruder head moves over the side print bed and begins the purge line. TURN OFF power before begins purge line.  With printer off; move the extruder head carefully over print bed by hand. Grab towards the top where the filament feeds in to avoid the hot extruder head.
Move extruder head back left corner. Lay piece of  paper on the bed and slide it under the nozzle. Once the paper is under the nozzle adjust the bed height so you can just feel the paper being grabbed by the nozzle as you slide the paper around. Repeat on all four corners.  Once you are satisfied, move extruder head by hand back to home position (back right corner over the white drip pan).  Turn the power on, go Utilities and select ""Home all axis"".

Update #2:
I had to remove the SD card due to ""0040"" lower memory.  DaVinci support said to re-seat the SD card.  This was not easy to do (had to unscrew circuit board in back panel); but in the process discovered a Class-4, 4Gig SD card.  I replaced this with a Class-10, 8Gig SD card. So far the 0040 error has disappeared.

Update #1:
It's important to CALIBRATE printer bed before attempting to print; or it will fail. The instruction says the printer was ""Factory Calibrated"" but the bed is still off.  You need to calibrate close(but not exact) to X,Y,Z axis of: 100,100,100.  After EACH print select ""Clean Nozzle"" and brush off excess filament on the metal extruder. If you don't do this; the tiny piece of melted filaments from last print will mix with your new print: resulting in fail. Also, if printing something w/ lots of details or arches; select ""support"" and ""raft"" in Advance print option on XYZprint software.  Orientation of item is also important for successful print. Have sharp razor to pry the model after it's finished; the plastic spatula provided is worthless!  For comparison; a friend who has DaVinci 1.0 said the print quality on 2.0 is better.  This printer unlike alot of other 3D printer comes with a door; what this means the smell of ABS melting and noise from printing is kept low. I can't help but stare at the thing printing for first few minutes; it's almost like baking watching anxiously for your creation to ""rise"" of of nothing.  Finally, I found tinkcad and meshmixer very helpful for modifying and creating 3D model for novice.  My 7yr old was using tinkercad to create army tank with squares and cylinder.

My first package was lost in during shipping. Amazon sent another next-day only after I sent complaint.
Now for product review.  The manual says not to calibrate since it's factory-calibrated; but mine would not print and ""Filament Jam"" error until I had to calibrate it several times and had to remove and re-insert the filament.  After that it printed the demo figure fine.
So far; I am impressed with printer in its look and print detail.  Only cons: use of proprietary filament cartridge, and XYZ software.",1.0,negative

"Based on a real-world example explained here, I recommend seeking a stronger and more expensive drill bit unless you are drilling a very soft and thin item.

I bought this drill bit to drill 1 3/8"" holes (the max diameter of the bit)  through two items made of steel, which also were bought from Amazon. It worked on one of them made of 29 gauge steel, and did not work on the other which is a little-bit thicker, and it is stainless steel. Here are the links to the two items:

1. A 29 gauge steel lid for a bucket (It drilled through without problems):
http://www.amazon.com/Vestil-LID-STL-LL-Steel-Lever-gallon/dp/B0052P1QBU/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1402917254&sr=8-6&keywords=vestil+bucket

2. A stainless steel cup (It did not drill through the bottom of the cup*):
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NG9DUK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

*Actually, I have persisted drilling, but for people with other options who are not trying to ""Escape from Alcatraz,"" it would not be worth the time and energy. The following is my progress.

The ad for the drill bit states: ""Self-starting, no walking and center punch is not required."" When I started to try to drill through the center of the bottom of the cup, there was no ""self-starting,"" there was a lot of walking (I presume this means instead of forming a hole where the tip of the drill is applied to the metal, the tip of the drill slips all over the surface without forming a hole). So I got out the center punch, and finally, after about an hour, I was able to focus the tip of the drill bit in a little tiny pin-prick hole in the steel. After about 1/2 hour more of drilling, the hole was visible to the naked eye in a good light.

This was about a week ago. I then thought that, just as a trickle of water eventually can carve the Grand Canyon, so too would this drill bit eventually drill a 1 3/8"" hole in the bottom of this cup. Therefore, every day I drill for about 90 minutes while I watch a movie. I am drilling by hand without a drill press,  but I have attached ankle weights to my drill for a less-taxing downward force on the drill bit and steel.

So in a week, my hole has increased to 1/4"", and I hope that today I will break through to 3/8."" Since the diameters of the holes are in layers on the drill bit, I am hoping that although one diameter may wear out the sharpness of the drill bit, I have proven, with the first 1/4"" layer, that after a lot of work it can ""break through,"" then I will start on the next diameter where the drill bit sharpness is brand-new. (Pretty sad that I have this sort of time, but that's another story.)",2.0,negative

2. Poor welded joints.
3. Rust found. There was NOT a protective coating of oil to prevent surface rust like stated in the description.

5. The metal handle is made of Soft Steel and is damaged easily.

This is one of the worst vice I've had the displeasure of buying. No matter what we did it just got worse.
There was almost no grease on the threads anywhere, and like I said earlier 2 of the Jaw screws were already
stripped out and we could not get them out even after drilling and using a screw extractor. They were frozen in
place due to Rust and paint.

One of the Jaws came off fine but I did find Rust underneath and on the threads. I was told by support at TEKTON that the
jaws are not meant to be repeatedly taking off.  Well I could NOT even get them off in the first place so I don't see how that was
even relevant. The ONLY and I mean ONLY reason I am giving this vice 1 Star is there is no option for ZERO. TEKTON your
custom service was unprofessional at best and this Vice made in Taiwan is JUNK!

"First off, I have TWO of these units, the first I'd purchased from Amazon, the second was a replacement sent free by Amazon when I requested a return on the first due to accuracy issues. I also have several vintage weather stations, with USA-made, mechanical hygrometers which I trust to be fairly accurate. Those all read within a few % of each other. I have them in several locations around my house, but wanted a small, unobtrusive temp/humidity gauge for my daughter's room that wouldn't detract from her 'decor'.

To test the first unit I'd received I simply put it in my basement (where the humidity doesn't fluctuate widely unless it's raining) next to wall-mounted weather station for comparison. The 'Accurite' unit ALWAYS READS WAY UNDER the actual room humidity - sometimes as close as 8% under, but usually more, like 12% under.  The second unit I received as replacement acts much like the first, although their readings for humidity always differ from each other, usually they're as close as 2%, but sometimes as much as 6%, and it stays that way for hours (so it's not some sudden change like the furnace coming on that's the problem). I should note their temperature display is pretty close, within 1-2 degrees of actual - close enough to work with,  if only the hygrometer were as accurate.

The reviewer who claimed to have subjected theirs to a test chamber and praised it's resulting accuracy...maybe the hygrometers in these units only work well in a test chamber. I need something to work in my home, and a bogus reading of 39% when the actual humidity is 51% is pathetic.

FYI, while writing this review I found a website that shows up close to the top of googled results for 'hygrometer', 'nwclimate.org', that hosts an article titled '8 Best Digital Hygrometers Suitable for Your Home', with this 'AcuRite' model making the top of the list. Considering their numerous spelling and grammatical errors (even the article's title is awkward), and their (unintentionally lukewarm) recommendation of this unit, describing the hygrometer function as 'good accuracy if you are not interested in the exact percentage; for relative ranges it does a good job', I'd judge these devices to be the cheapest made and hardest-sold imported junk on the web.",1.0,negative

"This stuff sticks all into the threads and gets torn up into tons of little pieces, so if you ever unscrew the fittings you applied it to, it's nearly impossible to remove properly.

I had a propane distribution arrangement constructed of several T's and such, and when I needed to remove one fitting for a change, this fact forced me to deconstruct the entire arrangement so that I could effectively get all the little bits and pieces out of the fittings.  What a pain!  I wasn't about to do that again, so this hit the trash and I picked up some liquid PTFE thread seal, which works MUCH better.  Not only do I not worry about contaminating the gas line now, but the liquid sealant helps lubricate the fittings making it possible/easier to tighten them down further.

I have a friend who has one of these and he has similar problems.  Currently when I calibrate it, the pen is 7 points over the calibration solution.  I bought another solution to see if it was a bad bottle of ph 7.  No, it is this pen.  It started to climb the more I used it, now reaching 77 on a calibration, so I have to add 7 to each reading to be sure it is what I want.  This same company make a ppm pen and it has lost its ability to demonstrate accurate pp.'s.  I guess this is just a scab outfit among the many these days.  I am switching to "" Blue Labs"" products as I have been told by a number of growers that they are tried and true.",2.0,negative

"If you use a lot of oats. . . then this is the way to go.  For either pounds worth (128oz) thats a lot of oats!  At the current price, its under a buck per-pound, so a great buy.

Also, whole, old fashioned oats is what you use when making your own granola bars and such.  If you want wonderful creamy oatmeal, then use milk instead of water.  For one portion bring one cup of milk to a boil.  Add  cup of hole oats.  Return to a boil.  Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for five minutes. . . stirring constantly.  Because of using milk, you must stir constantly, so that it doesnt scorch. .  but its worth it.  ..  tastes so much better then water.",5.0,positive

Because they have a flat bottom they stand up without tipping over and you can fill them without half of what you're trying to put into the shells falling out.

"The outside dimensions and design of this line splitter are fine. Both of my clamp -on ammeters fit the 1X and 10X holes well. And, the voltage meter probe holes are handy. But I immediately noticed that , when plugging into the female end, the plugs tended to spring back out.  This was especially true for two blade plugs.  Something was obviously wrong with the female receptacle contacts, so I took the device apart to investigate. Sure enough, the blade contacts were so far recessed into the housing that the plug blades barely made contact.  The internal shape of the plastic housing suggests that it was designed for longer blade contacts, but short ones were used instead. Also, one power wire was not soldered to the blade contact, as were the other wires. The unsoldered wire was simply pushed through a hole in the contact, but someone forgot to solder it. I modified the blade contacts so that plug blades would make good contact, and I soldered the loose wire. Still, however, the female plug receptacle contacts are weak, and will eventually break if this device is used often. To address that problem, I plugged a multi-plug adapter into the female end,  and I plan to tape or glue the adapter into place . That way, the unit's internal weak blade contacts will not repeatedly be stressed by inserting plugs directly into the unit.  Also, the stiff, solid wire inside is soldered to one of the plug receptacle flexible contacts. That joint is bound to eventually break as the receptacle flexes. How this device qualified for a UL listing, I'll never know. But, having spent about two hours modifying it , I do plan to keep it , and use it when needed.  ( The ""Kill a Watt"" power meters, also sold by Amazon,  are a better bet for most uses, and far more versatile.)",2.0,negative

"Have you tried ""regular"" brown rice but didn't like its taste or texture?  Give Organic Lundberg Brown Basmati Rice a try!

A true family favorite, we eat this rice at the majority of our dinners, plus our 2 Faithful Canine Companions also eat this rice in the home cooked meals I fix for them.  I recommend using a rice cooker to prepare this according to the rice cooker's direction.  Rinse first, then cook with a bit of olive oil and dried herbs; no salt.  The rice will turn out perfectly every time, separate flakey grains with a delicious nutty taste.  As a bonus, your kitchen will smell wonderfully from the basmati rice's mild popcorn-like fragrance.  Leftover rice warms up beautifully in the microwave with no change in texture or taste.

Lastly, the prime pantry price is an incredible buy, the 32 oz bag price is over $2 cheaper than my grocer store's $7 plus price!  A pantry staple I am never without.",5.0,positive

"I was extra excited to get these on subscribe and save. Idahoan are the only instant potatoes I can find without wheat ingredients.

They are that good. The bonus is that you only have to add water -- not water, milk, etc. Just 2 cups of boiling water and butter if you like, but they don't really need it. The parmesan and garlic flavor is subtle and really good. You can dress them up or just eat as is. We do both. One of our favorites is to make the potatoes as directed and spread in the bottom of a greased pan, then sprinkle with cheese and add 6 raw scrambled eggs, onion, green pepper etc. on top and bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes.

"I turned the locking lever to lock the measurement in place and the lever broke off.  I didn't use much force.  The screw on the lever screws into a thin brass tube and the tube had cracked all the way around its circumference.

Other than the lever the tool feels of good quality.  The thimble turns freely but with enough friction that your measurement doesn't shift, and nothing feels loose.  The smaller silver thimble sticks out of the end of the larger thimble has a ratchet such that as you tighten it down on what you're measuring, it will start clicking instead of turning, at which point you can take your measurement.

The gauge didn't quite read 0 when I ratcheted it closed all the way, but it did return to the same not-quite-0 point when opened all the way and closed again.  When opened to 1 inch my ruler said it was maybe 0.5 to 1mm larger than an inch, so it's not extraordinarily accurate at larger distances.

A small tool is included which can be used to change the 0 point.  The problem is that small tools are easy to lose, and it's got such a specialized shape I don't know how you could ever adjust the zero point if you lost it.

The manual say the little black plastic oval on the blue horseshoe is a ""heat insulating plate"".  I guess you're supposed to hold it there when reading hot things, or maybe when reading anything so the temperature of your body doesn't affect it?  The manual doesn't say, but the plastic is too small for me to hold it there without touching the metal, and I have fairly-small fingers.

The gauge reads in decimal inches with 0.001 inch markings and one full turn of the thimble equals 0.025"".  I find it hard to visualize what the measurements mean because I'm so used to dealing with inches as 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, etc.  If you're used to visualizing fractional inches as well as millimeters, you might want to get a millimeter micrometer instead.  The manual is actually written with an example of reading a millimeter-scale micrometer, which really confused me until I remembered this was an inch-scale micrometer.",2.0,negative

"First off, I have no real complaints about these wipes: they do a good job cleaning and they stay moist for fairly long. However, perhaps a tradeoff for how long they stay moist is that they seem a little soapy (the cloths themselves are actually very wet), and they tend to leave a bubbly trail wherever I use them. Despite this, it doesn't leave a residue or anything, but it is a bit unusual.

Do note the directions, which are typical for all such cleaners/disinfectants: to clean, just wipe the surface down as you wish; to disinfect, wipe the surface down so it stays wet for 10 minutes, then allow it to dry naturally. Rinse direct food contact surfaces with water--I actually do this with almost all of my surfaces in the kitchen, even though they aren't all food contact surfaces. (Again, this is standard procedure for most products.)

I find the rinsing also lessens the smell, which some people may find disagreeble. Personally, I don't mind it, but you might want to smell these in a store or buy a smaller container first before committing youself to a larger volume. The scent, lemongrass and thyme, isn't really intentional: it's a result of the cleaning product itself. Thymol is the disinfecting agent, and it smells like thyme; lemongrass oil is not listed as an active ingredient but may have antifungal or other beneficial properties, and I suspect that its inclusion (assuming the product does actually contain it) makes the scent a bit more agreeable. I would much rather have this smell than use other, harsher products.

The smell, by the way, is the same as in the lemongrass and thyme disinfecting spray cleaner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disinfecting-Multi-Surface-Cleaner-26-oz-Trigger-Lemongrass-SEV22810-Category-All-Purpose-Cleaners/dp/B0033UJ5QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disinfecting Multi-Surface Cleaner,26 oz. Trigger,Lemongrass (SEV22810) Category: All Purpose Cleaners</a>. I suspect the products are actually nearly the same, and I think in the future I'll actually just use the spray cleaner; that way don't need to use a disposable wipe if I don't need to. These are probably mostly useful if you need something on the go; for most uses, I suspect a regular spray cleaner may be better (coupled with a paper towel, you have the same thing; coupled with a reusable cloth, you've got an even more eco-friendly solution).",4.0,positive

"I compared this yeast to a popular brand of jarred, bread machine yeast. This yeast gets an ""A"" while the other yeast gets an ""F"" (which coincidentally is the starting letter of its name.) The ""F"" yeast did not last a month, even though it was stored properly. Within 4 weeks, it had lost its potency and failed to make decent bread. Meanwhile, this 2 lb bag of Red Star, kept in a sealed plastic tub in the freezer, has worked for months on end.

Just make sure you store the opened bag in a proper container to keep it dry and cool, and make sure to bring the yeast up to room temperature before throwing it into the bread machine. This is a very economical way to buy yeast. If it's too much for you, split the bag between you and a friend. I find I have to cut back on the amount of yeast in bread machine recipes; for example, 1 1/2 tsps means I'll use 1 1/4. This yeast seems a lot more active, so I find I need less.

They provide a conversion table on the bag; you may want to cut it out and save it. 2 1/4 tsp equals a typical 0.25 ounce or 7 gram packet of yeast.

I store my yeast in one of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oggi-Canisters/dp/B0002T4ZLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oggi Canisters</a>&nbsp;and keep it in the fridge.

"From the outside in ... The packaging was attractive and consistent with other products sold by iGaging (makes no difference but shows the company takes some pride in their products). Inside the retail box was a sturdy white cardboard box that contained the inclinometer, a nice storage pouch, the instructions, a 9V battery, and a tiny screwdriver. I expected the AccuRemote to be made of plastic but it's actually a cast metal, possibly zinc, quite sturdy and heavier than expected. The battery compartment is accessed by removing four dinky Phillips screws that jump to the magnets as you pull them out, an unintended but welcome feature as they would be super easy to lose and very difficult to find. The dinky screws + battery cover are too 1970's for me, there are better ways to cover a battery but including the screwdriver was a nice touch.

The inclinometer was easy to use, I didn't bother with instructions. I spent awhile measuring angles everywhere then going around checking the machines in my shop. I tried testing for accuracy the same way you would test a level, by flipping it 180 degrees, but got inconsistent results. According to this, after setting my table saw blade with an engineer square, I was 0.20 of a degree out. So pretty close but if this thing is accurate then it's nice to get that extra precision especially when cutting miters or segments for turning. My miter saw was dead on perpendicular, as I believed. My band saw was off .5 degree which I already suspected.

It turned out, the case of the device is not square to the bottom on all sides. So if you zero the device then turn it on it's side, it should read 90 degrees. The left side consistently read 90 degrees, the right side consistently read 89.70 degrees. Since I have a right tilt saw and would be using the bottom and right sides most often, being off by .30 degrees would just be annoying. I was also bothered that rotating the device 180 degrees does not give the same or reciprocal reading. And I had issues with precision (repeatability) especially when the daytime temperature was under 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So I sent the inclinometer back to Amazon. Based on the many reviews of this and similar products like the Wixey, I believe much of it is luck of the draw whether you get an instrument that is accurate and precise. So I wouldn't say iGaging makes poor instruments, just that digital inclinometers in this price range suffer poor quality control. The summary is I can not recommend for or against the product.",2.0,negative
"Good, fresh yeast, ideal for bread machine use.  I like to use this when I'm in a hurry; saves a bit of measuring time.

No need to drain it. The water version tastes so good to me that it's almost too good to waste on cats. But I think in the future I will pay the extra cost for the packed in water version. Bumble Bee makes a premium product no matter which version you buy.",4.0,positive

Packs more heat per squirt at a better price than any other I know.  A great tool to have in the cupboard to add firepower to any recipe.

Sole exception:  I prefer Frank's for buffalo wings..

Con:  the last time I kept a bottle more than six months, the cap separated due to being cheap plastic.  Also, the caps tend to break.  I complained to the company but got no answer. Don't fret:  you can pour the sauce into another container.  In fact, I bought some cheap polyethylene squeeze bottles on Amazon and put the Sriracha in one.  It works great, and the original bottle hasn't broken.  Yet, anyway.",4.0,positive
"Purchased this from my local grocer thinking I would love the combination of peanut butter and white chocolate ... after all, what's not to like about a peanut butter cup? .... but this spread was a disappointing dud.

The white chocolate flavor is a very muted white chocolate flavor, seems to simply add an in-your-face brash sweetness to the spread.  As if a bunch of sugar was added to peanut butter.  While labeled as a creamy spread, the texture has an unpleasant grainy mouth.  With the overly sweet taste and grainy texture, I literally could not eat it when I tried it on both toasted whole grain bread and toasted sourdough bread.

I then tried the spread in a peanut butter cookie recipe.  Another dud.  The cookies baked flatter, the peanut butter flavor was muted, and I could not distinguish a white chocolate flavor.  The cookies turned out way too sweet and flat, and went in the trash along with the jar of White Chocolate Wonderful Spread.",1.0,negative

"All of the translucent Solutech PLA filament colors that I have tried (Blue, Red, Clear) were brittle. They also contained an excessive number of air bubbles. On prints with lots of retractions in a small area (aka: prints with multiple small islands), the extruder drive gear frequently grinds through the filament. This leads to failed prints. This sucks. It is possible to down-grade retraction settings and prevent this. However, diminished retraction settings lead to stringing. Therefore, this filament leaves me stuck between a rock (stringing) and a hard place (grinding). It's not worth the trouble. That said, Solutech opaque colors seem to be OK. Colors are vibrant, but filament diameter variation is frequently greater than the stated +/- .03.",2.0,negative

The good news is that it cleans well for the sections you are able to use it. It gives that just from the dentist feeling in at least some situations--all for under $15! I love the small brush head compared to other brands as well.

So why did I rate it so poorly? Because unlike other battery powered toothbrushes (including more expensive Sonicares) the HANDLE vibrates so much it is distracting and hard to grip/control. Again, I directly compared this at the same time to other Sonicare models and the difference was shocking. That means you are wasting battery life vibrating the entire toothbrush and likely obtaining the power the engineers planned on sending to the brushhead.

Past that, the vibration is so rough that I, like other reviewers, felt I might chip or otherwise damage a tooth while using it. I certainly would not allow children to use it at all.",2.0,negative

"I have been an Electrolux devotee for more than 50 years and I was given this Dyson as a gift.  I like it well enough.  It is a little lighter to move about and suction is quite good.  However, there is no floor light nor does the cord retract.  I looked at the info and specs of the most expensive model of Dyson and the same is true for that model, no light, no retracting cord.  For the amount of money these vacuums cost, these features should be there.  Also there is no way to ""tone down"" the suction for the purpose of vacuuming drapes, blinds, etc.  All-in-all the suction of the Dyson is best but the versatility of cleaning features of my Electrolux is better, including reversing the hose and having a blower capability.  Left to my own devices, I would likely buy Electrolux again.

11/10/2014 Update: *I take away my 3 stars for this machine and would give it a zero if I could.  I have now used this machine three different times for about an hour each, emptying the canister midway and at end each time.  I did get significant dust and dirt. At 3rd emptying I stepped outside into bright sunlight and emptied it into a trash bag I had there.  In the bright sunlight all the fine particles of dust that billowed out and up as the dirt dropped out of the canister were visible.  DO NOT EMPTY THIS CANISTER INSIDE THE HOUSE!! (What fun on cold and rainy days!)  With my Electrolux this filth was all contained inside the bag and easily chucked.

*While dirt and dust are discharged from the canister easily enough, the canister itself is now filthy with coated dust on the inside and there is no easy way to clean it.  After about 45 minutes with a half roll and paper towels, an old tooth brush, my elongated ultra slim kitchen spatula and much meticulous and tedious maneuvering, I managed to clean what I could reach, but I know in the hidden, unreachable crevices, some dust still remains.  This canister should be water washable. With my Electrolux all the dirt and dust are trapped in the disposable bag.

*After such a collection of dust and dirt and the canister being so coated with dust on the inside, there was no doubt in my mind that the filters were by now quite dirty.  I removed the one from inside the canister (which was simple to do), and it looked as pristine as if it had just come off the store shelf!  I next removed the screw-on/off cap to inspect and ball filter.  That takes about 200 rotations of the cap, to the point I thought I was doing it wrong or it was broken.  Finally the ball cap released and again the filter was as clean as brand new.  I cannot understand how the machine could have taken up so much dust and dirt and yet filters appear untouched.  I am now wondering if this machine is possibly defective.  With my Eletrolux you do not have to go through all these shenanigans as all dirt is trapped inside the DISPOSABLE bag which contains a filter to prevent dust escape and the filter on the machine is readily accessible by removal on one tray.

*Now it's time to return the screw-on cover to the ball filter.  You must align the threads of the cap with that of the screw that holds the cap onto housing that covers the ball; a view of which is obliterated by the housing and cap itself, as you try to align it.  So you must raise the machine over your head with two hands so you can peak into the crevice to align the threads and with your 3rd hand hold the ball housing in place and with 4th hand turn the screw cap the 200 rotations to secure it to the housing. Needless to say, I don't as yet have this cap back in place.

*And I haven't even gotten to the point of trying the accessory tools and hose, which from other reviews I understand is somewhat difficult and unsuccessful.

THANK GOD I STILL HAVE MY OLD ELECTROLUX.  And, I think the age of my machine compared to the newness of the Dyson may well account for some of the difference in the suction power.  I would rather vacuum 2-to-1 with my old machine than to jump through all the hoops it takes to use the Dyson.  Frankly, if this vacuum had it not been a gift, it would be on its way back for a refund of the money.

Also, to add insult to injury, is the fact that the Operating/Use flyer that comes with the machine is basically diagram instructions only.  There is next to no written instructions.  There should at least be an introductory page that identifies by name and designation all the parts, buttons and filters of the machine.

"I have become a regular Zevia fan but it did take a bit of adjustment to the taste. I had not been addicted to carbonated drinks in the past but did, occasionally, ""binge"" on pop and cheetos. In an effort to get off of sugar I researched options and was impressed by the health benefits of low-glycemic stevia which is the sweetener used in Zevia. I actually grown stevia (also called ""sugar bush"") and, yes, it really does have up to 100 times the sweetness of sugar with none of the bad side effects. A tiny bite of the plant will overwhelm you with sweetness!

However, it doesn't taste like white sugar so it does take getting used to. My favorite Zevia flavor is Cola. I've tried most of the other flavors but find Cola tastes more like regular pop. It's worth the effort to switch. Once you do, you'll find that reaching for an ice cold Zevia is, indeed, refreshing and healthful!",4.0,positive

"I don't like to write bad reviews but I do always want to be honest and honestly this item is a bit of a let down.  I can't really complain as it was just under $3.00 but it isn't quality by any means.  The light itself is not very bright and the button to turn it on is right under the end of the clip.  This may be a common place to put the on button but here the clip is pretty tight so it seems to turn itself on even with the slightest unwanted pressure.  As far a pressing the on button it is very small so you have to make sure you press down just in the right spot or you'll be fiddling with it for sure.

On the plus side I do like that it is reusable so you don't have to just throw it away - just pop in a new battery and it is good to go.

Overall it is worth what I paid but not what I had hoped. I don't recommend the product I think there must be better lights without the issues I described maybe for a little more.

"I understand you get what you pay for and that I was not buying a professional machine shop style clamp but... I really don't like this thing. Yes, it has it uses but there are some major flaws.  I should have heeded the negative reviews before purchasing it.

Positives:
1) You can clamp the thing down and move your work piece anywhere in two dimensions in its range of motion

Negatives:
1) There is an extreme amount of slop on every movement.  When you reverse a direction on one of the directional screws you have to turn the screws 10 degrees before any linear movement occurs - this is for the clamp and the x & y axes. Forget QUICK 'precision' movements. Doesn't happen.

2) As you move the work piece in the x & y directions the body of the clamp tilts left/right and up/down. It moves around. Again, forget quick 'precision' movements.

3) The clamping jaws move side to side and up/down when you clamp something down. Again forget any type of precision.

4) The actual handle part of one of the rotary handles actually fell off. Immediately, it wasn't welded in place at all, the other one was... This is a big pain because as you move back and forth along that axis as you are working a piece you have to put the handle back in over and over again.

5) The gauges do not correlate to anything because there is so much slop in each of the turns; they have no value what so ever.

6) The set screws are garbage

7) The machined bearing surfaces are hardly machined

Overall, this thing is junk. I have used it many times. It has served its purpose but not very well. I have to admit, I expected more.",2.0,negative

"De Cecco is one of the better brands of Pasta from Italy. Not the best by any means, but pretty darn good.

In Italy pasta is graded with the letter ""i"" (lower case).
In the US, they can call almost ANYTHING Pasta. Major Brands like Ronzoni and Barilla (yes, Barilla sold in this county is MADE in this country with the same ingredients as Ronzoni) are usually half flour.

In Italy, even the WORST grade of Pasta is only allowed to have 3% or less flour.
Real Pasts is 100% Durham Semolina and NO flour.

The Italian ratings for Pasta are as follows:

 Dried pasta with three subcategories

(i.) Durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semola di grano duro),

 (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and

(iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour. Dried pastas made under this category must be labeled according to the subcategory.

So, first make sure your pasta is 100% Durham Semolina. De Cecco is.

Years ago, De Cecco used Bronze dies to extrude their pastas. that gives them a rougher texture to grab onto the sauce (gravy). They only do that now with a few of their varieties now. That's too bad.

If you want a real pasta that is made from the finest Durham Semolina AND that rough texture because of the dies used to make it, try Cucina Antica. Nice rough surface to hold the sauce and a very high grade of Semolina that you can smell the aroma of when cooking and serving. There are many other high end pastas that have that great semolina taste and aroma and rough surface to hold onto the sauce, but they can cost about ten bucks per pound.

Like I said, De Cecco is a good brand of everyday pasta, but you can also get may other brands from Italy that are about equal to De Cecco (like Anna, Farrara and a bunch of others) for less money. Just check that they are from Italy and are 100% Durham Semolina and NO flour.",4.0,positive
"I was unpleasantly surprised to see the Spotnails packaging label list in bold ""304 Stainless Steel"" when that important stainless steel information should have been in the description and the sales image. IMHO this borders on false advertising!

These are 304 - I was hoping for 316 stainless steel like the 2"" Bostitch brand ordered together with these.

Anyone ordering stainless steel materials should be informed of the quality. A simple way to 'somewhat' determine the quality of stainless steel is to try and lift or roll the item from side to side with a powerful magnet. The lesser amount of iron, 316 for instance, the better for marine or severe environment service. 316 stainless steel is practically non-magnetic. The lower the number, as in 304, the more iron therefor the more it is attracted to a magnet. A powerful magnet will lift these bards easily as seen in my attached photo.

I purchased both 3/4"" and 1"" sizes, both appear to be 304 stainless steel as is properly labeled on their packaging, unfortunately nowhere was this information to be found on the Amazon site at the time I purchased 10/15/2015.

In addition these were ordered early in the day for 'Same Day' delivery as described at checkout. I received a confusing email that they were delayed while the Amazon site still showed 'before 9pm' same day!

"I have a teenager who's allergic to a lot of things in soaps and cleaners so for most of his life we've been washing his clothes and rinsing them twice. We decided to try these and sure enough, he didn't have the reaction to it like he does other brands BUT they also don't get out body oil! Some of his t-shirts and things that had been washed in this were put away seasonally and I kid you not, when he took them out to wear them again they reeked to high heaven of rancid body oil--absolutely disgusting. Even supplementing with extra additives did not help.

Now if you use these for an additive, like throw a pod in in place of borax or washing soda, to another detergent they work out pretty well. On their own I suppose they're okay if a person basically doesn't actually do anything in the clothes they wear but around this house people tend to do things that result in real dirty clothes and these won't touch them.",2.0,negative

"All Bran Cereal, Original, 18.3-Ounce (519g) Boxes (Pack of 5), by All-Bran.
This Kellogg's All-Bran cereal is chewy, but it does not stand up to milk for very long before becoming soggy. It is time consuming to eat.  It is boring, without much taste, only a little better than eating brown corrugated cardboard.  I mixed it with other cereals like Rice Krispies and Special K to make it more interesting. A normal cereal serving size is 1 cup.  This cereal has a serving size listed as  cup, as one cup of this cereal might be more than you want to deal with.  Sorry, Kellogg's, there just isn't much nice to be said for this cereal. Eat a banana for your Potassium instead.  Kellogg's is playing with the numbers, as a normal one cup serving would yield a high calorie rating of 160mg, a high sodium rating of 160mg, a very high Carbohydrate rating of 46g, and a very high Potassium rating of 700mg.  Two stars.

"I ate my bumble bee snack on the run for lunch along with an apple and it kept me going until dinner time which was amazing.  I guess it is the protein....anyway, the tuna is good, though I couldn't really discern rosemary, garlic or sea salt as dominating flavors, so if you are looking for a big flavor explosion, you won't get that.  What you will get is a nicely flavored tuna salad, much like you would make at home, not just a can of dry, flavored tuna.  My one drawback on this one was a small one.  Not enough crackers.  I had to really heap the tuna on the crackers-I believe there were 6 to use most of it and still ended up eating some out of the container, so a few more crackers would be good.  The crackers are Ritz like and go well with the tuna.  Other than not enough of them, they went well with the kit.

Overall, I would purchase this in this flavor or others to keep as a quick pack to take on a hike, eat as an emergency lunch or to just have on hand.  Very handy, very compact and a nice protein packed snack.",4.0,positive

"First of all, the bearings in these are total garbage. They wouldn't slide smoothly at all on a hardened steel shaft. So I swapped them out for some nicer bearings, and all was well.

Second, the mounting holes are not threaded their entire depth, just the first couple millimeters. The threading also wasn't straight on one of mine, but off at about a 15 degree angle. If you need these threaded the entire depth, you need to buy an M4 tap to go with it. Just be careful you don't follow crooked threads and break your tap.

Finally, these still have a rough cast finish. The bearing surface really needs to be milled flat, which I did on a little desktop milling machine.

After my modifications these were decent, but as they come out of the box there are unusable. Don't buy these unless you plan on fixing a lot of flaws.",2.0,negative

"These are the traditional oats you've loved all your life.  They take a little while to cook (5 minutes, not instant), but are worth the wait.  They have the great nutrition you expect from oatmeal.  If you like them sweetened, I recommend putting the sweetener in the water (with the salt, if desired) before adding the oats.  Brown sugar is the bomb this way.

You'll want to transfer them into a suitable container as you open each 4-pound bag, since the bags don't pour or seal very well.  There are 2 bags in the box.  These must be packaged for food service, as it says ""not for retail sale"" on the box.  The ones I got are best if used by about 18 months from receipt and actually should be good for 8-12 months after that.  If you can use 8 lbs in about 2 years, this is an economical way to buy your oatmeal.

I tried being sure to thoroughly wash/soap/rinse the areas where the electrodes were, but it's still extremely uncomfortable.

"Quaker Oatmeal Squares, Cinnamon, Breakfast Cereal, 14.5 oz. (411g) Box, by Quaker Cereal.
It is difficult to get very excited about this rather bland cereal, even with a little cinnamon to give it some taste.  It is too sweet, it is very chewy and slow to eat, and it is medium-high in salt content (190mg). Salt (Sodium) is not good for anyone with high blood pressure, or anyone trying to control fluid retention. I emptied the rest of the box into my birdfeed barrel.  Mixed in with the regular birdfeed, the birds and squirrels did not complain, and the food did not go to waste. I could only give this Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon Breakfast Cereal two Amazon stars.

"This is the first time I had ever seen this product but I was shopping for a new lotion and I do like Jergens and when I saw the coconut oil on the front I was immediately intrigued. Coconut oil is a staple in my house from cooking to beauty. The smell of the moisturizer is the only thing I like. When I put it in my hand it instantly felt like conditioner as I started rubbing it on my skin. I let it ""soak"" in for 15-20 minutes before feeling it and it felt just like my hands did. I can't really explain the feeling, but when I rubbed my fingers together it made a weird sound. I feel like it's too weird to describe. I am going to have my daughter try the moisturizer and see how she likes it, if she is a fan I will update my review and give her take on it, but for now it's got a 2 star rating because of the smell and the price.",2.0,negative
"The Eureka Rapid Clean was fairly easy to put together. The product feels extremely lightweight in a kind of cheap way. The vacuum portion (which clicks off to a handheld) seems to be something like a Dirt Buster. The vacuum comes with a slight charge but I wanted to test it fully charged. I was surprised at the charge time required - around 17 hours but thought that perhaps it had to do with a much longer lasting use period. Unfortunately, this was not the case. It certainly took the 17 hours to charge but the suction degraded at around ten minutes. It was fairly useless after twenty minutes and dead after twenty-five. It will take another 17 hours to re-charge. Frankly, this is unacceptable charge versus use time. I couldn't vacuum my ground floor in twenty minutes let alone both stories of my house.

The vacuum advertises itself for bare and carpeted floors. It has a beater brush but has no way to stop the brush from rotating. Because of that, I would never suggest using it on hardwood. It would beat the wood and perhaps scratch it or worse. My other vacuums all have a switch to stop the rotating of the brush. The RapidClean did an okay job of picking up dust and so worth from a low pile carpet as long as I was pushing it with the grain of the carpet. The moment I tried to switch directions, it became difficult to push and buckled the head up. I had to walk around to find the direction I needed to push or it would not work properly.

I tried to vacuum my tile floors but found that it was not picking up things at all - probably due to the degraded suction as time went on. I have short hair cats and it was unable to pick up their hair or their litter very well. The receptacle filled very quickly due to its small size. When I went to empty it, what litter had been picked up fell back through the stick onto my hardwood floor. It wasn't being held in the receptacle but was somehow in the stick. I had to get out another vacuum to clean up the mess that the Eureka made.

I have recently used a Rowenta RH8548U1 Delta Force 18V Cordless Bagless which I really like. It is twice as expensive but works well on carpets, tile, and wood floors. It has a 40 minutes battery life and takes much less time to re-charge. If it is in your budget, that is the cordless that I would recommend.

I don't recommend the Eureka RapidClean 2-1. It has a short battery life, long re-charge cycle, not really useable for hardwood floors, questionable suction, and extremely low capacity dust cup (it really is about a cup!) There are better and cheaper corded vacuums and for a bit more money, there are much better cordless ones.",2.0,negative

"The lifespan of this device seems to be quite limited. A couple of years ago, I bought 2 of these for my 2 boys. One of them stopped working after a couple of weeks - was able to return it to Amazon and get a replacement - and the other stopped after a little over one month. The replacement stopped working after about one month as well.

The big problem with this toothbrush is the battery compartment. Since it's using 'throw away' batteries, a bad thing by itself, there is a need for a lid to allow removal/insertion of batteries. At this price, the lid does not close tightly and water creeps in. Eventually, the entire thing stops working.

Pros for this toothbrush:
- low price.

Cons:
- short life due to almost inevitable water damage
- use of 'throw away' batteries

My recommendation: avoid.

Spend a few more and get a true Sonicare. You won't regret it. I've been using Sonicare tooth brushes for almost 10 years now. My first one was replaced after more than 5 years, mostly because I wanted a new one. My current is alive and kicking and it's likely to last for many more years if I don't choose to replace it.",2.0,negative

To avoid the waste, reclose the near-empty carton with the cap.  Tear off the cap and the screw-on mounting; this will leave you a hole in the top.

They provide almost the nutrition of the fresh fruit plus a lot of fiber.

They're organic, sun dried and unsulfured. They're quite good figs but I've had better tasting figs and these are a little drier than most I've had. They also seem a little less sweet. That's OK.

"So when this soup first hit the market about a decade ago it blew my mind. It had nice big bits of chicken in it, and was loaded with vegetables and rice. The flavor was mind blowing full of herbs tasted better than fresh homemade soup, in fact for years I have tried with my homemade soups to get the same amazing sage flavor that was in this canned soup and have failed.

I loved this soup and then it was gone, couldn't find it anywhere anymore.

I was so happy when I found this on Amazon. It came I opened the box heated up a can right away and was so disappointed.

There are hardly any pieces of chicken in it now, seriously there were like two pieces of chicken in the first can I opened. Hardly any veg, except for tons of nice cheap carrots, how do I know carrots are cheap, because that's what this is a can of carrots. There is not even much rice in it. Worst of all the flavor is gone, no more amazing herby greatness, just kind of a watered down version of it's former self.

"Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: ""You can work with me!""  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM.

"Review for:  Lutron 822-A Fully Digital EMF Meter

OVERVIEW:
-----------

Measures EMF strength of low frequency (30Hz-300Hz in this case) portion of AC MAGNETIC FIELD (NOT AC electric field, too) from ONE AXIS (direction) in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT).

Because cell phones and microwaves are in a much higher frequency range, this product does not measure EMF (RF) at those frequencies.  You would want a separate meter for that.

The Achilles Heal of this instrument is that the design is HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings. The accuracy is not 4% of the displayed value (+ 3 digits) but rather THE ACCURACY IS % OF THE VALUE OF THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT RANGE (4%x200mG = +/-8mG (+ 3 digits).  Since most consumer EMF checking is in the single and low teens mG, this is unfortunate.

This will do fine for noting the EXISTENCE of stronger EMF at lower frequencies, but appears to be a highly inaccurate choice for MEASURING it.

MAIN VALUE:
------------

- Measures EMF at 30Hz-300Hz low frequency range (Magnetic AC field only, not Electric AC Field), which covers most EMF generated by AC power in most homes/offices.  60Hz (U.S.) and much of the EMF generated by resulting harmonic frequencies .. 120Hz (2nd harmonic), 180Hz (3rd), 240Hz (4th), 300Hz (5th).

CONS:
------

- HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings .. a fixed +/- 8.3 milligauss (mG).  Since most suggested defensive limits for extended exposure are 1mG-2mG or so, this greatly limits its utility.  See paragraph above under ""The Achilles Heal of this instrument.."" for more detail.

- Measures only AC magnetic field (mG/uT), NOT AC ELECTRIC FIELD (V/m,mW/cm2, etc.).  Adding electric field measurement with decent accuracy would have added greatly to the cost.

NOTES:
-------

- Like other meters anywhere near this price range, the company doesn't claim this unit will filter out <30Hz and >300MHz EMF as well as academic/professional units like the Enertech Emdex II filters out EMF from outside its measurement range.

- This frequency range does not cover cell phones or cordless phone signals, microwave oven radiation, or other high frequencies often referred to as RF (radio frequency).

SAMPLE EMF MEASUREMENTS:
-----------------------------

There is no definitive consensus nor clear epidemiological evidence yet as to how much milligauss (mG) for extended periods could be harmful (within reasonable home/office real world levels).  However, there is a consensus from studies that staying under 1mG-4mG would be a good defensive strategy in case 20-40 years from now longer term studies (think smoking, etc.) start showing stronger causal relationships.  Most folks who care about this aim for under 2mG, preferably under 1mG, especially where pacemakers can be involved.

EMF METER SHOPPING GENERAL NOTES:
--------------------------------------

EMF FROM LOWER FREQUENCIES:

At LOWER FREQUENCIES we can measure magnetic fields (in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT)), and higher end units also measure electric fields (V/m,W/cm2, etc.).  Unlike higher frequencies where magnetic and electric fields are strongly coupled together, at lower frequencies you measure them separately.

As noted elsewhere in the review, for biological exposure it is suggested to play defense and keep prolonged exposure from lower frequency Magnetic Fields to under 1-4 mG (preferably under 1-2 mG) but there is no definitive consensus as to the long term biological dangers, and where the safety lines are.

Regarding Electric Fields of 50-60Hz (AC Power), there is some rough consensus out there to keep below 10-20 V/m and sleep at a spot below 5 V/m, though again opinions vary.  5 V/m was the recommendation in Germany and by the IRPA/INIRC for ""private individuals"", 10 V/m for ""workers"", with 25 V/m for ""workers"" for max. 2 hours.  ACGIH recommend 1 V/m for those with pacemakers or other electrically sensitive implants.

The fields in the lower frequency ranges are sometimes referred to as ELF (see chart below for usual acronym meanings of this sort), or even confusingly as EMF which is also often used to define such fields at most frequencies.

EMF(RF) FROM HIGHER FREQUENCIES:

At HIGH FREQUENCIES like those the high frequency meters measure, the magnetic and electric fields are coupled so strongly together that it is one field that is measured, usually in V/m or mW/cm2, etc.

For microwave ovens (2.45 GHz) biological exposure is often recommended to not exceed 5 mW/cm2 (milliwatts per cm squared), however again opinions vary.

Some school or hospital exposure limits for 300MHz-300GHz:
- France, Italy 10 mW/cm2 in schools
- Switzerland 9.5 mW/cm2 in schools, 4.25 mW/cm2 in hospitals
- Belgium, Luxembourg 2.4 mW/cm2

For RF Fields of 900MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 4.5W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.

For RF Fields of 1800MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 9W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.

The higher frequencies are often referred to as RF (radio frequency) frequencies (think cell phones, microwaves, etc.) and thus you'll see some meters with ""RF"" in the title or description.

MAGNETIC VS. ELECTRIC FIELD MEASUREMENT:

AC MAGNETIC FIELDS are much harder to shield than electric fields.  On the other hand unperturbed AC ELECTRIC FIELDS are much harder to measure accurately/dependably than Magnetic fields.  IEEE tries to help with IEEE 644-1994.  The inexpensive models don't pretend to measure this as well as the Enertech Emdex II's of the world, however they are often much less expensive and there's your trade-off.

Note that AC ELECTRIC FIELDS often remain as long as the the source is plugged in, whether it is turned on or off.

So for biological concern, what do people care about, magnetic or electric fields?  An engineer in the field that has been following this noted that in the 70's it was electric fields, in the late 70's and 80's it was magnetic fields, and now it's really both.  Most inexpensive units are only good for detecting the PRESENCE of stronger fields (vs. measuring them well) and many only measure magnetic fields, and if they do measure electric fields it usually isn't accurate.  If you need to measure accurately and/or measure both magnetic and electric fields, I try to help out in this review with some leads later on.

GENERAL:

Meters not designed for it avoid 0Hz since that is the natural ground DC static field and we usually want to ignore that for measurement.  Also there is often comparatively little EMF produced 1Hz-40Hz (some European train systems do FYI - 16.7Hz).  Thus meters often aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover below 30Hz-40Hz.

The frequency range of 30Hz/40Hz to 300Hz usually covers much of low frequency EMF produced in a home or office.  This includes the U.S. 60 Hz AC power frequency and 4 of the harmonic frequencies from that.  Thus we usually aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover over a few hundred Hz or so.  However, note that capping the upper end of the low frequencies in the low hundreds may fail to capture a good portion of CFL's EMF (compact fluorescent lights) if that is important to you.

Note that measured values can become less trustworthy as you get very close to the source of an EMF field, so measuring practically next to the source is often questionable.

Also note that pulsed EMF is usually not read accurately by EMF meters.

Note that if you need to take high radar frequency field strength into account (think Traffic Control Radar, Aviation, Naval, Military) because say you live near an airport and are wondering .. you'll probably need a meter that reads in the 8.5GHz-9.5GHz range.

Note:  I can't imagine who might work so close to one, but keep CFL bulbs without specific UVB and UVC mitigation (think double-envelope eco bulbs, for example) more than 20cm/8"" from people at the bare minimum.  If you don't know the technology of your CFL bulb, might as well play defense.

SOME ORGANIZATIONS REVIEWING
EMF/RF BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS:
---------------------------------

Here are some of the more scientific organizations with available EMF/RF research or overviews that might be of interest to you:

ACGIH - American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.
IRPA - International Radiation Protection Association
SCENIHR - Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (European Union advisory group).
INIRC - International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee
ICNIRP - International Commission on Nonionizing Radiation Protection
WHO - World Health Organization International EMF Project
U.S. EMF RAPID Program - 6 year working group put together in the past by NIEHS, NIH, and DOE.
NRC/NAS - National Research Council / National Academy of Sciences by way of National Academy Press
CA Dept. of Health Services - CA EMF Program
IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
VDB - Association of German Building Biologists (Verband Deutscher Baubiologen)

Further future related research discoveries are likely to involve, or at least be reported on, by one or more of these organizations as they have been involved in such research in the past (much of it you can find on the web).

HOW TO GET 3D READINGS FROM
FROM 3 XYZ AXES METER READINGS:
------------------------------------

While some tools take ""3D"" readings, to save money some folks buy meters that read 1 or 3 individual axes, not a composite ""3D"" reading.

To make a ""3D"" reading out of the individual axes readings you are supposed to put each of the three axis meter readings into the equation ""square root (x-squared + y-squared + z-squared)"".

However, here are some short-cut estimations for less demanding needs that some use:

Measurement Value:......Corresponding Guesstimate
1 High, 2 Low values....Use highest value
2 High, 1 Low value.....Use highest value plus half of second highest
3 similar values........Use 1.5x highest value

MEASURING SUGGESTIONS:
--------------------------

Consider/test:
- Keeping unit over 1ft away from any conductive material like metals.
- Putting unit on a non-conductive holder like dry wood or cardboard.
- Reading meter from 5 feet away.
- If measuring over a bed, measuring 2"" above mattress to take pillow into account and lessen the measurement effect of the springs (if there are any, of course).

SOME OTHER METERS:
----------------------

If looking for a high-end, accurate low frequency EMF meter, consider starting your research with these:

(1) ENERTECH EMDEX II
  Measures AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields in the 40Hz-800Hz range, 3-axis, 1-2% of value accuracy.  Sold to power companies and universities in 50+ countries, this is a leading industry tool.  It also has recording, event marking, and software capabilities consistent with the needs of consultants.  It is also excellent at filtering out EMF outside 40Hz-800Hz and is unusually accurate in reading AC Electric Field. ($2,950 for base unit)

(2) GIGAHERTZ SOLUTIONS meters
  Made in Germany, sold in North America through Safe Living Technologies, Gigahertz Solutions has a wide variety of accurate affordable models that cover many frequency ranges priced from under two hundred to over a thousand dollars.  Here are some of them, all these listed have HIGH ACCURACY and measure both AC MAGNETIC and AC ELECTRIC fields:
3030B 16Hz-2KHz ($175)
This model is a value sweet spot for non-professionals, offering most of everything one is looking for in accurately low frequency magnetic and electric fields.

SPECTRUM ANALYZERS.  To measure EMF/RF field strengths AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES you will need a spectrum analyzer.  Some consultants use these for higher-end analyses, however there is usually much more expense and skill involved clearly.  Below is the maker of an affordable hand held spectrum analyzer solution you may wish to read up on..

(3) Aaronia AG Spectran handheld spectrum analyzer
I suggest reviewing their website for model options if considering these, there is a variety of models and bundles covering different frequency ranges, covering both AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields.  The U.S. Distributor is Kaltman Creations (Aaronia AG is in Germany).
- Low Frequency Range Examples:
Aaronia AG Spectran NF-1010E (10Hz-10KHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields, 5% accuracy)

(4) If you are considering spectrum analyzers and money isn't much of an issue you might consider reviewing Tektronix, HP, and Agilent offerings, too, perhaps others, just to know what's out there at the high-end if nothing else.  Of course, for most folks this is way out of budget and often skill set.

"Really great vacuum here. Really gets the dirt and pet hair off the carpet. The hand attachments are great for cleaning the furniture.

Id like to edit my previous comment on this vacuum. I posted my previous comment right after I purchased it. Granted this vacuum performed excellent when it was new, but not even a year has passed by and it is completely destroyed. I use the vacuum once a week at best so I got less than 50 uses out of it before it was ruined by a terrible design flaw. The problem I have is with the belt slipping. Once the belt starts to slip it will begin to create a ton of heat in the housing. Over time the housing which keeps the belt stable and in place began to thin and melt away. It eventually just couldn't hold the belt in place anymore. Then it would get caught up in the housing and make the vacuum smoke until I turned the power off. The amount of time this vacuum lasted for me is completely unacceptable. I used it normally and it replaced a vacuum that was over 7 years old under the same conditions. Now I am without a vacuum, out ninety dollars and no contact from the seller.  Do not buy this vacuum, look elsewhere.",1.0,negative

"The printer prints good but its design has a flaws that allows a connector to become unplug during printing and then shorts the printrbaord and Printrbot will not fix this under warranty as well as their support is all but useless for this problem and their sales site does not function currently as the California tax calculation is incorrect so my attempts to purchase a new board are not successful so I have a dead printer I can not fix. I do not recommend purchase of this product till there are some serious changes to this product and Printrbots warranty which claims to cover material and defects but actually they do not cover a bad selection of a wire that has open metal pins with no protection from shorting if it becomes disconnected during use on a product made of metal especially this is not a common design feature with most manufacturers and the connector is not locking to prevent unintended disconnection as well as the male and female connectors are not of the same type so they could be locked. look at the included photo and you will see the open metal pins that have no protection and this coming from the Printrboard and carries power and signal from the board to the auto leveling probe. but remember they choose the compenets but this can not be a material defect on their part, normally a power providing cable would be femal on the supply side and male on the component side so I concider this a defect no matter what Printrbot calls it.",1.0,negative

1 .5 cups of sugar
2 Tbsp. Lemon Juice
1.5 Tbsp Citric Acid.
Mix everything together and stir. You can add fresh sliced lemons, mint, or berries to the punch if you are serving for guests, however you will want to remove them if you are storing this in the fridge for any length of time.

I only tried PLA 3mm I wanted to try ABS but now with the bad results I got I don't have the motivation, I am going to review this filament on my Youtube channel and live print and compare it with other PLA as well but for here this is my review:
1. its inconsistant with its diameter, the tolerance of error is very large it can go from 2.90mm to 3.5mm at times, I hardly had consistency with this PLA.
2. it does not print good quality and warp as if it was ABS, I found that weird but I have pictures to back me up.
3. it variate very quickly to temperature change, I usually set 210 for PLA and this brand either don't flow good less than 205 or at 210 it start stringing.

I printed examples, 2 different brands, white is IC3D and Green is ColorFabb and you can judge for your self

"Another one of my top 100 products to be found in my home is Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix.  It's quite inexpensive, one need add only 1 egg, a bit of milk, bake and voila!  Cornbread is ready in a few minutes. This cornbread is often used as a side for my hamburger vegetable soup, however, since Thanksgiving is this week, I thought I would also post my cornbread stuffing mix recipe.  This recipe will make enough stuffing to fill two 8/2 x 11 inch pans.

Ingredients:

4 boxes of Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix baked and crumbled up
1 or 2 packages of bread crumbs (depends on whether or not you enjoy more or less bread crumbs mixed in with the cornbread - I use about 1 1/2 packages)
8 boiled eggs (cut up in small pieces)
2 large white onions (diced)
1 pkg of celery (diced)
2 cans of sliced olives
1/2 cup of chopped walnuts
If you have giblets available and your family doesn't object, cut up and add giblets (my family doesn't like giblets)
3-4 boxes of chicken broth, or 4-6 cans of chicken broth

Mix all ingredients into a very large mixing bowl (reserve the chicken broth).  Once the ingredients are mixed, begin pouring chicken broth into mixture, stirring as you pour.  If you like your stuffing a bit dry, you will need to use less chicken broth.  If you like your stuffing more juicy, you will need to use more chicken broth.  I then season my stuffing/dressing with sea salt, garlic powder and a bit of poultry seasoning.

After everything has been mixed, place stuffing contents into your two pans.  I normally use two 8 1/2 x 11 inch aluminum throw away pans.  Cover with aluminum foil and cook for 30-40 minutes at 375 degrees.  Remove the aluminum foil for the last ten minutes.",5.0,positive

I bought 14 of these for production of parts for my company and I regret the day I made the decision.  Expect to replace wiring harnesses and motors and main boards weekly.  These machines do not hold up to normal use let alone high volume production.  When they work they work well but when I own 14 of them and they are all breaking daily then there is a problem.  Don't expect to get ahold of anyone at the 800 number they never answer.  When you email them expect broken English responses where they don't understand simple English and it takes a week to get the problem worded in a way they understand.  THEN THEY TELL YOU TO SHIP THEN BACK AT YOUR EXPENSE FOR REPAIR!!  These things weigh a lot so expect to pay $75 plus to ship to California and hope it doesn't get damaged in transit to them because they WILL NOT REPAIR IT!!  Also do not use their filament it's terrible.  If you dare to buy one of these cheaply built machines buy a cartridge reset offline.  What they charge is highway robbery.  You can buy hatchbox filament for $22 for a 2 pound roll versus $28 for a one pound roll.  The reason the machines are so cheap was they figured they would get you to buy the product and rape us all on filament.  I also own flash forge machines and would recommend if you want one that never breaks get one or else expect to be waiting for emails from xyzprinting for a week or longer and expect each time it breaks down to be offline a solid 2 weeks each time.  I submitted an issue yesterday again and still no response.  It took them 24 hours to copy and paste what I emailed them to their online system that has code written by a child who does not understand how to design a intuitive user friendly website.,2.0,negative

"I had bought this in April, 2014, I have been using it in my 2nd floor master bedroom since, I had it set up on schedule every weekday while nobody was at home, it worked ok, once in a while I would find it somewhere on the floor nowhere near the base, so I had to pick it up and put it back, the next time it would work fine again.

However the problem became more persistent starting from two weeks ago, it happened everyday for 10 days in a row, so I decided to call this company and tried to get this issue resolved, the 1st time I called, I was asked a whole bunch of questions that gave me the impression that they were trying to deny there was such a problem, there was question about the location of the home base, the distance between the home base and the virtual wall, blah, blah, blah, and this lady told me that I had to watch Roomba while it's working and see if there's any error message that might indicate what the problem is, so that's what I did on Sat. an Sun., the same thing happened, no error message given. So I called them again on Monday, after 20-min's hold time, I was only to be told to run more tests, that's when I said enough is enough and asked to be transferred to a supervisor. Well, she came on and offered more trouble shooting tips and kept me on the floor trying different things to no avail for half an hour, finally she gave up and said they would send me a replacement without a battery or any other accessories. After the hour-long phone call, I received an email from them stating that there's no warranty for the replacement after the original warranty runs out, which from my understanding is you get this piece of junk for $700, after that, you will be out of luck. I will never buy anything from this company again.",1.0,negative

"We had been buying Kirkland's mixed nuts and decided to try these. I found them a little too salty, although I'm glad they use sea salt. I also didn't read the print and see that peanuts were just under 50% of the nuts. The other nuts are almonds, cashews, brazil nuts, hazelnuts and pecans.

To be five stars for my taste, I'd lower the salt to 2-3% instead of 5% - then you could taste the nuts flavor better. The salt overpowers the different subtle nut flavors in here and they all taste about the same: salty. And I'd lower the peanut content to perhaps 30%, if possible. Might be fun to include some macadamia nuts in here, too.

If you like peanuts and you like salt, however, these would probably be a 5-star treat for you.",4.0,positive

"I have the 18"" model. It ran 12 hours a day for 6 months then suddenly stopped. I turned the fan blade by hand and noticed it would hardly budge. I took the motor apart and the sleeve bearings on either end were almost dry. I packed some grease into those bearings and reassembled the motor and it is now working, but I don't think my fix will last long.

When I first got the unit, I noticed that spinning the fan blade by hand was more difficult than I expected. The sleeve bearings are too high in friction so you pay for electricity to overcome this as well as create a lot of heat that tends to eat up lubricant.

The shutter assembly is understandably very thin and light weight. Unless you mount it to an absolutely flat surface, the slightest racking of the aluminum frame will prevent the shutters from opening or closing.

And, the taper was sharper and longer than any other nozzle I've used (10K+ hours of printing). I ended up throwing these 5 away. The sharp point tends to snag on lower layers as it passes over them in non-print moves. In fact, the only prints I could do had to be sliced so that the nozzle would never pass over a perimeter or to do a Z lift on all retractions to ""jump"" over existing lines. And the sharp point also ""grated"" over lower layers, making for a very noisy print.

"If you rate this popcorn based on taste alone, it deserves a five star rating.  The flavor is absolutely delicious, and one might find themselves devouring the entire bag at one sitting.

Now for the bad - The parent company is Frito Lay. This is a corporation who is guilty of poisoning its customers daily through using GMO (Genetically Engineered) corn in their products. When I first decided to purchase this popcorn, I bought it because on the bag it specifically states No Artificial Colors, Flavors, or Preservatives.

What I didn't notice until later, was a line on the bag that says - Partially Produced with Genetic Engineering

So basically, my take on this product is that instead of calling this Frito Lay Popcorn, they disguise it by calling it ""Smartfood delight"" - making us think that this is a healthier alternative by claiming that it has No artificial colors, Flavors, or preservatives...but if the popcorn itself is GMO (Genetically engineered) Corn, does anything else really matter?  There is nothing healthy about GMO foods. Furthermore the companies who try to feed them to us through deceptive marketing and advertising should be punished or at the very least called out publicly and shamed for their unethical behavior.

The reason I decided to give this product a 1 star rating is because I want people to read my review, and I don't feel as if a 2 or 3 star review would get looked at, as much as a 1 star review.

I also want to reiterate that the product does taste delicious,  so if you are the type of person who doesn't care about whether or not you were eating genetically engineered foods, then this product is a popcorn that you would buy based on taste alone. As for the rest of us, I feel like I just got bamboozled because I didn't read the bag close enough when making the original purchase.

"I tried the Sonicare and was really surprised by how powerful it is....even in the the ""sensitive"" setting. This just seems like too much. Saving time brushing will usually mean you are brushing too hard, and likely cause gum recession and tooth abrasion. You need to brush softly, but for between 2-3 minutes, 2-3 times/day (as well as flossing, which nothing can replace). ""No pain, no gain,"" does NOT apply to toothbrushing. I certainly would not recommend this for your teeth. I think if they can tone it down 75%, it might actually be good. The gum ""massager,"" mode makes no sense. Proper tooth and gingival care has more to do with the prevention of accumulation of plaque, etc., and ""massaging,"" the gum is just a great marketing idea. I think the only people who really need to use an electric toothbrush are those with dexterity issues, etc., and they may benefit from the use of an electric toothbrush, but the trade off, e.g. recession, etc., may not be worth it. Also, you can't really try to put less pressure on it, because then it will not clean that well. I can also tell you that you will spurt toothpaste all over unless you wait to turn it on when it is in your mouth...the vibration is just that harsh. If you accidently hit your tooth with it, and you will, you will feel like there is a jackhammer in your mouth! I know there are a lot of people out there who are huge fans of these....I am not one of them. If you are still considering this item.....You only get one head, so if you want to share this (if you are a fan) you will have to spend more on another head. It does come with different colored rings so you can identify different brushes, but those rings slip around, perhaps because of the harsh vibration (I pressed pretty hard to put the two pieces together). The actual quality is very good, and it feels sturdy and not cheaply made. I just cannot recommend something that makes my teeth hurt after using it, no matter how it feels, or how cool it looks (and it does look pretty cool and hi-tech). For about two-three percent of the cost of the Sonicare (and no operating cost) you can have a superior instrument to keep your teeth and gums healthy.",2.0,negative

"It's not popular anymore to ""like"" pre-prepared convenience foods.  I don't care - I found this stuff to be super convenient and the taste is a real treat.  Here's what it is . . .

The box for a single serving (250 calories) is about the size of a couple of decks of cards.  Contains a small round can (about 2.5"" x 1"") of the tuna product, and a sealed foil package of a half dozen round buttery (Ritz type) crackers.  A little spreading spoon is also enclosed.  3.35 ounces in all.  No refrigeration required.  The tuna opens easily with a pull open tab.  So, what did I find inside?

To be honest, with the name, ""Cheesy Tuna Melt"", my hopes were not high.  I expected some bland tuna goo in a bland cheese sauce bath.  What I actually discovered was a totally pleasant surprise . . . . This is what I would have called a very, very good tuna salad.  Well seasoned with a pleasant tartness an identifiable morsels of tuna, celery, cheese, water chestnuts and so forth.  Very tasty.  I piled it high on each of the six crackers and still had a little left over (which I finished off using the little spoon).  This served as my lunch - I always prefer a very light lunch and this was just perfect for me.

Some variations -- I ate mine at room temperature, but I think it would have been even better a bit chilled.  For my taste preferences, if it's handy I might do a shake of black pepper on it next time.

I received one serving of this snack at no charge as part of a promotional program in exchange for doing an honest product review.  If I don't like it, I'm free to say so and I always do as appropriate.  But this one is a great discovery for me.  I'd buy this.  I WILL buy this.  I'll also snoop around and see if Bumble Bee is offering anything else in this line.  Delicious and ultra-convenient.",5.0,positive

"I was unpleasantly surprised to see the Spotnails packaging label list in bold ""304 Stainless Steel"" when that important stainless steel information should have been in the description and the sales image. IMHO this borders on false advertising!

These are 304 - I was hoping for 316 stainless steel like the 2"" Bostitch brand ordered together with these.

Anyone ordering stainless steel materials should be informed of the quality. A simple way to 'somewhat' determine the quality of stainless steel is to try and lift or roll the item from side to side with a powerful magnet. The lesser amount of iron, 316 for instance, the better for marine or severe environment service. 316 stainless steel is practically non-magnetic. The lower the number, as in 304, the more iron therefor the more it is attracted to a magnet. A powerful magnet will lift these bards easily as seen in my attached photo.

I purchased both 3/4"" and 1"" sizes, both appear to be 304 stainless steel as is properly labeled on their packaging, unfortunately nowhere was this information to be found on the Amazon site at the time I purchased 10/15/2015.

In addition these were ordered early in the day for 'Same Day' delivery as described at checkout. I received a confusing email that they were delayed while the Amazon site still showed 'before 9pm' same day! I could have driven across town and purchased from a brick and mortar shop but paid more on Amazon to save time on a time sensitive project! I called but the rep was unable to offer any solutions.

"A convenience food, this instant grits cheese lovers variety is fast and easy comfort food, but the chemical additives, artificial colors and flavors and crazy high sodium level are hard to ignore. I try to avoid monosodium glutamate and failed to notice its inclusion in two of the varieties.

Even if ignoring the ingredient list, the primary flavor is salt. The product is simply too salty. The sodium level in one small packet of any of the three flavors is high  420, 460 or 480 mg  approximately 20 percent of the daily value.

Preparation is easy. Cooking a minute or a minute and fifteen seconds in a microwave with one-half cup water or milk. I tried it with both liquids and the difference in taste and texture was not significant.

I understand snack food having high levels of sodium and including lots of chemical additives, but it just seems a natural grain product should avoid these inclusions as much as possible. In the future I will stick to plain grits and control what is added into the bowl. The best if used before date on the package is four months in the future.",2.0,negative

 give it to kids (they rarely complain about something being too sweet!  Particularly if I don't mention beforehand what ""I"" think of the drink.);
 take a walk through a desert  and dehydrate myself. ( Crazy thought, ignore me);
 throw it away (As if!  It's not that bad.);
 return it to Amazon (which would cost more than what I'd originally paid).

All things being equal I'd have to NOT recommend this particular Pepsi drink.

Obviously, MY recommendation would be for any of you reading this review is to buy any of the following Pepsi products of which I am a HUGE fan!

 Pepsi (with real sugar)
 Vanilla Pepsi
 Cherry Pepsi

In addition, (if you've read this far) I'd have to say that I've tasted the regular as well as the sugar-free version of the above-named Pepsi products.  I really like these soda flavors, regardless of the method used to sweeten the drink.",2.0,negative

"Wow I am so surprised at the poor quality control of these test leads.
FIRST THE GOOD: Unlike the cheap plastic test leads that were supplied with my new Fluke 177 (which was frustrating,) these upgraded Fluke test leads have fantastic flexible wires, and they are somehow slippery so they don't want to tangle at all.  Five stars on the wire.
BUT THE BAD: The first set of leads I ordered came with a perfect red lead, but the black lead was warped, slightly banana shaped.  What the heck?  These are supposed to be top quality.  So I arranged to exchange them with Amazon, and Amazon had a new set here the very next morning.  Kudos to Amazon!  But when I opened them up, this time BOTH leads were warped.  In opposite directions, so it's clearly not an intentional thing.  And besides, I got ONE lead that was perfectly straight.  See photo.  Also, on one of the gray probes, the ""grip ring"" towards the front of the probe was sort of distorted/melted somewhat (not seen in photo.)
It just seems crazy that Fluke's quality control is so poor that they let such obvious defects get through.
I might expect this from cheap Chinese knock-offs, but these are definitely genuine Fluke - the packaging matches all of the other Fluke products, and the listing says it's provided by Fluke.
I'm at a loss of what to do at this point -- no other lead I've tried comes close to the flexibility and pleasure of these cords...but it's so annoying to pay so much money for a defective product.  Do I roll the dice and try to exchange them for a THIRD set?",2.0,negative
Wow! I have to say years ago I tried vinegar and salt chips and hated them. But a few years ago a convention were passing them out en mass and I was hungry so I took some. They were amazing.

"I'm not much of a fan of excessive goo in my food. This cheesy tuna melt blend is a bit heavier on the sauce than what I would incorporate into a tuna snack.

This snack kit comes with a package of six crackers, one 2.75 ounce can of cheesy tuna melt flavored tuna mix, sealed with an easy-to-remove, tabbed, foil lid, and a little flat plastic spoon-shaped thing to spread the snack.

The flavor is thick, beyond my own liking. The snack pack satisfies hunger for a little bit. I almost wanted to rate it three stars, as being ""alright,"" but considering I have no desire to have another, I suppose a two-star ""I don't like it"" is in order for my particualr review.

As a portable snack, Bumble Bee Snack On The Run is an exceptionally convenient option, having everything needed to enjoy the snack while on the go included.

This is for people who find a saucey tuna snack appealing. I tend to like my tuna blends to balance out at the point at which the tuna is incorporated just enough that it is not dry.",2.0,negative

"I have bought these cookies numerous times but will never buy another Kashi product again. Those ..... downsized the cookies significantly but left the box the same size! When I opened the box there was 3 inches of empty space. That is correct the cookies tray was now 3 inches shorter than the previous version and the cookies were a lot smaller. This is really unscrupulous to me, they are trying to make you think you are buying the same product but then when you get home and open the box, you get about 2/3 or less of what you used to get.

I am now wondering what else Kashi is lying about, probably about everything. To me Kashi is a very disreputable company for doing this and I will never buy another Kashi product.

"I purchased these bits via Amazon Prime from ""Fargo Enterprises, Inc."" (which was the seller for which this item was being offered with ""Prime"" eligibility at the time).  Based on the glowing reviews, I thought I was going to get a great set of bits.

What was sent to me was a bunch of cheap, poorly constructed bits--three of which had heads that were BENT upon receipt (needle-nosed bits) and BROKE when I tried to (very gingerly) bend them back to shape.  The rest of the set has been equally disappointing in performance.  They quickly overheat (with the grit melting off), break and lose their grit with little applied pressure, etc.  At $6 and change, I feel what I received was still a complete waste of money.

I do want to stress that the company I purchased the item from was this FARGO ENTERPRISES, INC.  However, I am rating the PRODUCT because it is the quality of the product that I had issues with--NOT THE SERVICE of the company from which I purchased it.

"I purchased this to use in a Suddenly Salad recipe from the back of the box. I'd been familiar with poppy seed dressing in the past because it's one of my favorites for salad. Normally I buy Marzetti or Heartland brand (the kinds that are kept refrigerated in the store) but I needed it for the recipe and was ordering from Prime Pantry anyway. It was on sale, so how different could it be?

Turns out, it could be really different.

For one, both Marzetti and Heartland don't have dairy in them. Neither does the Panera dressing from the restaurant, which is what got me hooked on poppy seed dressing in the first place. The dairy in this wasn't a deal breaker, but it's weird. Sour cream in salad dressing? Maybe in a ranch style, but even homemade poppy seed dressing doesn't usually have sour cream in it.

It's texture is much heavier than the other two brands. I found it unpleasant.

It's less sweet and tangy and almost has an odd aftertaste.

The poppy seeds are the amount and texture you would expect them to be.

Normally I love Kraft. I'm a huge fan of the company's products, especially many of their salad dressings. However, this one was a huge miss. Sadly, this is going to end up in the trash, unused. It's not at all like my normal poppy seed dressings.",1.0,negative

"This toothpaste took some getting used to because it doesn't have a very strong minty taste and contains peroxide. After using it for about a month, I haven't noticed any big difference in the whitening of my teeth, which is what it claims to do. Perhaps by the time I finish the tube I will see some noticeable difference.

But two other things concern me with this product. First is the price of over $6 per tube for less than 3 ounces of paste. I agree with others that the tube does contain lots of air, which certainly makes it feel like you're getting more than what it actually contains. There are plenty of other whitening toothpastes that cost much, much less.

The second thing that concerns me is where this is manufactured. The label states that it is ""Distributed by..."", so my guess is that it is made overseas someplace. Remember the toothpaste scare three years ago from the stuff made in China? Since that time, I've tried my best to check toothpaste and other oral hygiene products to find out if they're made in the US. While this certainly doesn't guarantee that the product will always be safe, it definitely makes me feel safer. I will pass on future purchases of this product and stick with American made Aquafresh. Not only does it taste better, but it is much, much less expensive.",2.0,negative

"This is a soup that tastes and feels like a meal.  The sweet and robust tomato soup is hearty with pasta and diced tomatoes and a touch of kale.  Add on top of that an Italian sausatge that has a slight bite.  Just enough spice to set off the sweet tomato base.  Good enough to be in an expensive Italian restaurant without the price tag and the need to dress up.  Plus, you can eat it as is, or top with a touch of mozzarella or Parmesan cheeses.  Sometimes I put both.  I am such a daredevil!  Seriously though, this is perfect for a cold night when you want a soup to stay with you, and not leave you hungry in a couple of hours.  The pasta and protein in the soup make sure of that!  It is so good that my local grocery store cannot keep it in stock.  Thank you Amazon for allowing me to keep it on my shelves!",5.0,positive

"While the switch itself seems to be of good quality, I think that the Amazon listing could be a little misleading especially for non-EE customers (most of us).  The title lists that max current as is 20A and it is but it looks to me, and I am no expert so could be wrong, that this only applies to certain types of loads.  The information is actually in the product description in this cryptic string:
Ue : 660V;Ith : 20A
Le : AC-15 4A/5AAC-3 5.5AAC-2 7.5AAC-4 1.5A
The AC-15, AC-3 and AC-4 codes appear to tell you the maximum current for specific ""utilization categories"".  With literally hours of research, what I believe this means is that the highest load for the blower motor I want to use this on (AC-3 Squirrel cage motor), the maximum current rating is 5.5 amps, a far cry from the 20 amp maximum rating.  Again, I am a novice so I could be misunderstanding what I have read but my 1/2 HP motor uses 9 amps at maximum speed (12-13 amps to start) so this might not be the right switch to use for blower motor control.  If they are going to list an item on a retail site like Amazon, they should really decipher the codes designed for electrical engineers to help prevent the rest of us from using this in an application it is not designed for.  At a minimum, they should provide links to the data sheet which I cannot find anywhere on the internet.  The only application that I have been able to find this described for on other websites is switching between lines for an ammeter.  So unless you know how to interpret the technical specs, find a product that is designed for your specific application.",2.0,negative

"Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: ""You can work with me!""  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.",1.0,negative

"When I fill up my deep fryer, I use a peanut oil I get at the local warehouse, and it is darker and has more of a peanut taste.  I think this must be more highly refined.  I have used this to top my fryer off though when the level got low because it is easier to handle than the great big jugs or boxes that I buy.
BUT, I love to keep one of these 24 ounce bottles around for high temperature grilling and frying.  This is a good size to keep in the cabinet above my stove- it's fairly light so it's easy to grab, open and use just a bit of at a time.
The flavor is a delicate peanut flavor and it's a very light, very clear oil.  You can smell the peanuts and it does have that taste, it's just not super strong- it never overpowers delicate foods.
It is really good for pan grilling steaks, though sometimes I use grape oil instead.  I tend to like to marinade in olive oil, but using the peanut oil in the bottom of the grill pan boosts my cooking oil to a high smoke point.
It's good - it's a very convenient size.  It's just perhaps a bit too refined for some uses, but that's a plus for delicate foods.  It has its place in my kitchen though.",4.0,positive

"Apple cider is beneficial for conditions that can increase any signs of Gerd which may include Obesity, Hiatal hernia, Pregnancy, Smoking, Dry mouth, Asthma, Diabetes, Delayed stomach emptying. I insure to consume apple cider with water+grounded cloves before my workouts within the same time that I consume my power drinks with different seeds that I ground. Only USDA approved apples, produced in US, in glass not plastic container, organic, raw, not pasteurized, not heated, not filtered. Pasteurized is worthless since just like any type of pasteurized juice regardless of the fruit, vegetable, etc. lose nutritional values. This is apple nothing else, nothing more. Apples are a healthy part of my diet and apple cider is a convenient way of getting my daily organic apples rather than making a trip to grocery store on daily basis. Although refrigeration not a requirement, I refrigerate. I use a straw when consuming so I would avoid getting the mix on my teeth as much as possible and make sure to rinse after since vinegar can be very damaging to teeth enamel. No brushing for couple of hours till saliva has dissolved any trace of the vinegar.

HAIR: For no shampoo and conditioner to cleanse my hair I use no shampoo mix at all, since I make my own shampoo and conditioner. For shampoo I mix water+baking soda, half and half, cold boiled water AND water+organic apple cider, half and half, cold boiled water for conditioner. I do not mix in advance but mix just before jumping in shower. Need to keep it out of eyes completely. It takes few uses for hair to get used to it but the results are amazing. Now that process takes time and effort. For less effort, I mix 2 part organic castor oil, 2 part organic apple cider vinegar and 6 part shampoo. No conditioner, no more of anything other than the mix and sometimes I even add some EVOO or Wheat Germ Oil which is the highest in vitamin E. The effects are so immediate that after applying the mix I feel the effects on my hair immediately in the shower. I insure to mix a little at a time and always rinse hair with coldest water possible since it adds volume unlike warm water which destroys volume, but shampoo it with warm water. Tweak the mix according to the type, color and length of the hair but always insure to keep the mix away from eyes and scrub the mix on the scalp for the benefits of castor, apple cider on scalp and removal of any residue on hair. I do not shampoo my hair every single day since it damages hair and the natural oil of the hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but castor oils omega-9 fatty acids can help. Can apply the oil on the whole scalp for few minutes or before washing it off completely with apple cider vinegar.",5.0,positive
