"Problem with battery life but otherwise good since it's plastic so won't break when my brother drops it",
"All I can say is this tablet, for the money, is a damned good spec. But the way the engineers programmed the build is too stupid for words. As with most android devices, volume levels and increments vary wildly. But this tablet is excessively loud. So much so that, within 2 months of light use, the built in speaker is completely buggered and is now dead. And why is this? Well it's because some genius set the boot up music to play at full volume, which is extremely loud, and negated to give the common courtesy of putting an option in the settings to disable it. So that leaves the user with a deafening boot music every time the tablet boots up. And here we are. I now have an almost brand new tablet with a blown speaker. Thanks guys. I am furious.",
"This is a compact device, suitable for all ages to use. A great gift for younger children and at 1/4 of the price of other tablets/devices on the market. My children don't care if it is an apple or Samsung. As long as we can connect to the WiFi download our games and connect to YouTube kids they are happy. Great size for little ones and you can add on their educational games. Video could be developed on as the image is not completely clear, but if you do not intend on videoing with device I would give it a thumbs",
"Bought this tablet for my son, he's autistic so it was cheap and easy to use as he has broken many tablets before. The battery doesn't last, gets maybe 2 - 3 hours use then dies. But charges quickly enough but that causes some arguments. Overall I wouldn't recommend this tablet unless it's for simple usage.",
"Arrived on time.",
"Does what it says on the box",
"I've only had this for 6 weeks, it progressively lost battery faster and and faster and now it won't turn on at all! It just keeps this red battery symbol when charging.",
"This tablet doesn't charge when it finally does it doesn't hold it jumps from 100% to 24% in 2 minutes very disappointed child at Christmas",
"HD screen? Ha! No chance Camera isn't much better than VGA. Bluetooth is temperamental. Doesn find most things and wont pair to ones it can see. Tablet operates fairly quickly in terms of loading pages but ive got no apps loaded yet so imagine it will only get slower. Touch screen poor quality. LCD display has a line already showing its face. Plastic bezel has gaps and feels like a one drop and it will fall to pieces. I wouldn't buy one for a youngster it wouldn't last and older people will get tired of the poor quality resolution. Battery life is blow average. My 7 inch £80 lenovo lasted 2 years in storage and still had battery life! Better to pay more and buy a brand where the spec really is what you're getting",
"Bought primarily as a low cost e-reader. Price and delivery good. Screen not very bright, not suitable to use in sunlight. Battery runs down extremely quickly.",
"It's small, however, that's what I wanted, I basically wanted something the right size to read on that could access Google play. The device is bigger than the screen which means it fits in my universal case nicely. It was £42, I chose blue as was cheapest colour option at the time and I have a case that's blue. It seems robust and battery seems to last okay for several hours and it charges up again fast. It's okay for what I wanted and would probably serve well as a kids first tablet it has a parental control option as well - though I haven't tried it. Update: battery life is okay, more than enough to read a couple of books. I couldn't get a glass screen protector for this model.",
"I love the product, good quality Would recommend it to my friends.",
"So annoyed! Brought 2 of these in October as a Christmas gift. Daughter’s had them for all of half hour, can’t charge as no charger fits in the charger port in the tablet it’s way too small for any charger to go in it. Now I can’t return as I’m out of the time frame as I bought it back in October. Absolutely disgusted, for the price I wish I’d of got a fire tablet or second hand one! Not a happy customer at all! Couldn't proceeded with review until I rated it, didn’t want to rate at all but had to to proceed this.",
"Bought this for my child for Christmas had case everything on it and all the screen is just gone black I want a new one or my money refunded",
"You get what you pay for",
"The item is rubbish to not buy. I have had the tablet for 4 weeks and now it won’t charge and I am unable to return it now. 39.00 down the drain.",
"Wish I'd bought the Amazon fire tablet instead only tenner more to buy but smoother game play and better DISAPPOINTED AMAZON SELL THIS AND FOR JUST A TENNER",
"Do not waste your money on this item. the battery needs to be charged to often due to its life span 1 hour max then it's dead. Bluetooth is on and off. WiFi is useless I wish I'd nether had purchased this piece of junk. g Hall",
"low battery,very slow to use..generally very poor it is",
"Battery life awful and now won't charge at all , only had it just over a month and now no option to return",
"Stopped working with hardly any use after 5 weeks and as it was only covered by amazons 4 weeks return policy I’m stuck with it. Total waste of money.",
"I bought this tablet for my daughter and have had it for 5 months, used for about an hour a day. I picked it up today and the battery was very hot, it has melted the tablet cover and burnt my hand. I am just so glad I picked it up instead of my daughter and put it outside in case of fire risk.",
"Used this tablet once, the battery died and it won't charge again so has become unusable. Absolute waste of money.",
"Was extremely disappointed on this item I fully charged the tablet download 1 thing left it for a hour or so came back the battery was at 5% very poor",
"This no changes battery just very bad quality",
"Thi time zone is stuck as China and can't be changed, so apps that depend on a time function can't be properly used",
"The prosser chip is not up to the task. With more than one tab open it drains the battery and it runs out of power in less than an hour. If you try to return it the post office will not accept it because of the battery and the courier will charge you £45 approx. To take it.",
"Supposed to be an Android 11 machine but doesn't run the most basic educational programs or games smoothly. Screen is impossible to see at any kind of reasonable viewing angle and, though purportedly HD, is fuzzy and unreadable. Even though it is "cheap" it is not worth the money.",
"Battery dies on lock. Whack",
"My kid used it for a game, he didn't enjoy playing with it",
"Had for 2 days power button fell out and won't charge",
"It come damaged but was resolved really quickly",
"Vary poor pictures quality, did the full set-up, but poor poor.Returned the next day.",
"Stopped charging after the second day",
"It doesn’t come up and when it comes up it’s blank",
"It won’t charge",
"I bought this tablet for my brothers birthday on the 8th of august it’s been 8 days and the tablet is clean and seems like it had no problem however the touch screen stopped working and can’t be used anymore, do not buy this it’s to cheap to be a true product",
"Battery only holds for less Than 2 hours while using it, wifi is poor on it, you have to be near the actual router because when it the other room the internet is so slow (fine on our other Devices) overall very slow reaction on opening apps etc. Wasnt expecting much for this price but was definately expecting more than what I got. Charger was faulty, and camera is very bad",
"All I can say is it’s poo",
"For carrying round doors to show people video clips from JW.Org,really good size to slip in jacket pocket",
"Came on time. Brillant for the money"
