"Have had this a few months now, it replaced a Sony tv that was over 20 years old and on its final legs. We are really pleased with this product great picture, superb sound quality but most of all easy to use, us old foggies don’t always understand Lol. What completely sold it to me was the fact that it was delivered and installed for us with a human review. Yes there was a charge for this but much cheaper than all the other places I had looked and the two men that came were very helpful. Would recommend TV and installation thank you Amazon.",
"It's got great picture quality and excellent sound. I would recommend it",
"A great Tv, I was going to buy a much cheaper one but as it was marked down a lot on a Black Friday deal and had good reviews I decided to splash out. The picture is very clear bright and precise, I don't do gaming so can't give any stars for that. I have only given 4 stars for the remote control because the volume control and programme changer control knobs have a plus and minus - which is just raised but not marked with a colour - as they are small I cannot see them. The engineer who fitted the tv remarked on this, I'm quiet surprised because apart from this the tv is very good quality. I suggest that these controls need to be more clearly marked as everything else on the control is quiet clear.",
"I'm really happy to buy this tv ,very good quality picture & sound,easy to install,it took 30 minutes to set all channels and register,there is no guide booklet but when you turn it on you can follow the tv Instructions step by step,very good looking,with 100 Hz refresh rate, bring a very nice picture quality, the only reason I gave four star because the remote is small and some time you can get confused and press the wrong button,and I payed nearly 25 pounds extra for delivery to Amozon to bring the tv to my room, but the driver refused to that,and finally we sorted it out,so make sure they do your order correctly,overall I'm very pleased with this tv and I recommend. Good luck",
"This TV has a great picture even when it's upscaling HD content. Watching the football in 4k is excellent but make sure you turn off Tru motion which smooths the motion. If you don't then the picture ends up slightly blurry. The only downside with this TV is the set up and user interface, i think they've tried to make it easier for the user by having an app and having a modernised user interface but to me it just made things more complicated than they needed to be. You get used to it though. I don't use the app at all.",
"The size I originally wanted 65 inch, was not available and was subsequently cancelled, I downsized to 55 inches, no regrets at all. LG OLED Tvs have the best picture quality IMO, I went to a high street before purchasing off Amazon as I wanted to view what I was purchasing 1st. I set this it up myself, from start to finish, including logging my Netflix and amazon prime accounts, took me 25 minutes. It's clear, easy to navigate and sound quality is also good. I watched a review on YouTube before setting up which made the setting up process easy. Also I don't normally leave reviews, so for me to leave this, It's because I am impressed.",
"Received this LG today and was set up within 20 min and at first glance I am very impressed. Excellent picture quality and using a Denon soundbar which gives an awesome sound. For anyone who's confused on which oled to buy in a similar budget... Buy this LG, you will not be disappointed.",
"This is the 4th lg tv they all have been good but this one is brill, it was so easy to set up it was completed in about 1/2 an hour",
"Great TV",
"As good as picture quality gets...stunning!",
"I've had a number of great LG TVs but I'm afraid this new OLED will be my last. The picture's great, the sound less so, but it's the software design that's a bloated nightmare. It took me ages to locate the various scattershot menus to change defaults and create a clean interface and settings, at which point along came an OS update that inserted the irremovable 'LG Channels' app. It's sponsored and full of ads and bargain-bin programming, and it sits in a priority spot on the inputs screen. No option to delete. I finally got rid of it by changing the location in the user agreement so the set thinks it's in Italy, where the app's not supported. To cap it all, the screw holes don't match a standard VESA mount and I've had to bodge it onto my existing wall bracket. I wanted an upgrade from my 4k Samsung with its cloudy LED dark areas, and picture-wise I got it; in every other area it's tinged with buyers' remorse.",
"I deliberated for ages over which TV to get, and thought I would try an OLED. My other TV is an LG LED and has lasted well - but I have never been impressed by the picture quality. This one is certainly a lot better. My LED set looks quite grainy, which is not a problem with this model. As with all OLEDs, the picture is darker than an LED, and the screen is very reflective, so it looks best in a dark room. I only dropped a star because it was rather expensive for a 48 inch. Chances are the price may drop, or there may be some black Friday deals. I would buy it again, but probably not at the same price.",
"It was really easy to set-up and gives a great picture out of the box. I really like the fact that it has 4 HDMI ports as it's surprising how quick these get filled once you've added in a soundbar, tv box, external drive etc. The only thing I don't like is the remote....even though the pointer feature doesn't always have to be used, it can't be turned off. In summary, a fantastic tv that works well in all types of content but a shame about the remote.",
"Been waiting for this to come on offer - pre Christmas - as best buy form Which. Smallest OLE|D available and we do not need a bigger TV. Very happy with picture but did have to buy a sound bar with voice enhancement due to out ageing ears.",
"Fantastic tv worth every penny thank you",
"The 4K, HDR and sound is amazing on this television absolutely perfect for my Xbox series. X",
"Superb in every way.",
"I bought this tv a week ago. I have to say, i am impressed by the quality of the picture and sound. I have tried it on hd/4k and game and it work perfectly well. The colours are amazing and with some adjustment of the brightness, this is a perfect TV! The only issue is that we noticed a strong smell of burning oil coming out of the back of the TV and it has not dissipated after a week of use. I have contacted Amazon and we have agreed to return it for a refund as it could be a default with the TV. It is a shame as I really enjoyed the image/sound quality of the tv. Best OLED under £1K out there!",
"Pretty easy to set up, if a little complicated to understand once you have done it! I use it with an Apple TV, so I am not bothered. However, there is a thing called LG TV which is quite good apart from the adverts! The remote can function as a mouse - a fast mouse! It will operate with a Sonos for surround sound, but only if you buy a Soundbar it seems. It does not really need a soundbar.",
"The stand was easy to build, but it is massive and heavy; it is quite correct to suggest two people as lining it up would be impossible as you cannot hold it with one hand!",
"Pleased with the product, but need time to understand the set up procedures, not sure if I have the settings correct. However, the TV is a good quality but wish there were more written explanations regarding set up procedures.",
"Good looking tv with great sound and picture, but difficult to watch dark scenes it all blends into one. I have yet to explore the settings so maybe I can change this. Have to say though if I had been aware of this I would not have bought it.",
"Bought as Black Friday deal and delivered really quickly. Set up was simple and with connection to Prime Video, Disney+, Netflix, etc. via QR codes.",
"Excellent Product",
"Lovely picture for movies and Xbox. Never spent so much money on a TV before and it’s nice but could have got close for much cheaper. Can only download YouTube but not itv or bbc player?",
"This is an excellently engineered TV, in every way. Films really pop as if in a cinema. Dolby Vision, HLG and HDR2 support means the BBC or Netflix will never look the same again - this seems to be excellent coverage so far, as compared to the Samsung own proprietary HDR standard in terms of coverage. PS5 games are amazing, with no lag with Game Mode. The interface is really well thought out too.",
"Got the 48” version and the TV cannot be switched off, the TV has a mind of its own as experienced by another reviewer. It switches back on after about 5 min of switching off with the remote. The switch on the TV does nothing and seems stuck. Have to unplug TV from the socket overnight. Not sure if TVs that have not quite passed the quality checks are being sold on Amazon as new for less. In process of returning for a refund and not sure whether to buy from Amazon again.",
"Image quality was very good but I seem to notice uncomfortable judder which may be due to the out of the box setting that the TV was on.",
"So happy I purchased this TV. At 65 inches it is an absolute beast and the display is fantastic. Cant believe how good the colours are and surprisingly the built-in speakers are good too! Exceptional performance with PS5 and would highly recommend.",
"Despite many adjustments I could not achieve a quality image on this tv. I have many years experience of colour management in the photo industry so understand all the variables. No way could I obtain a picture as good as my ancient Panasonic Plasma. Returned to Amazon at considerable expense.",
"Had for less then a week had a black line appear on the screen can't get rid off it now have to send back somehow as don't have original box",
"We are trying to fathom our way around TV at the moment. Only had it set up 2 days still learning",
"The screen looks so vibrant and is a massive step up from my old 4K LED LG TV. Looks really nice and the sound is amazing without needing a soundbar.",
